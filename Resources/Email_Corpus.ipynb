Hope all\\nis well with you.\\n\\n\\n            Nov.2 email text\\n\\n\\nWe at Cornell\\'s Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\\nbeyond.\\n\\n\\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \\nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\\nspeaker at the Johnson School\\'s Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\\n2001</underline>.\\n\\n\\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\\nPresident of Kodak\\'s new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \\n\\n\\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\\n\\n\\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\\nthey can\\'t do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \\n\\n\\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\\npractices make this possible.\\n\\n\\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\\n1997.

We would like to devote a small research team to\\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\\nway.\\n\\n\\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.

       " 'Dear Kelly:\\n\\nI appreciate your comments regarding Enron\\'s advertising focus.  First, Enr=\\non=20\\nbecome involved  with Enron Field for two reasons:  to keep the Astros in=\\n=20\\nHouston and to gain energy and facilities management business for Enron=20\\nEnergy Services.  Acquiring the naming rights to the stadium came much late=\\nr=20\\nin our negotiations with the Astros.  In addition, while sports events like=\\n=20\\nNASCAR are exciting to watch and get a fair amount of media play,  we\\'re=20\\ntargeting a more specific audience with our advertising dollars.\\n =20\\nIncreasingly, Enron=01,s integrated products and services require the appro=\\nval=20\\nof an organization=01,s highest ranking officers, people who carry a =01&CX=\\nO=018=20\\ntitle, such as chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief=20\\ninformation officer or chief technology officer. These individuals may not=\\n=20\\nrecognize Enron=01,s name and abilities as readily as energy-centric execut=\\nives.\\n\\nWe also want to reach the elected and appointed officials who set policy an=\\nd=20\\nregulations affecting Enron businesses worldwide. The \"Ask Why\" advertising=\\n=20\\ncampaign launched in February this year was designed with these groups in=\\n=20\\nmind as well as to put the Enron name and image on everyone=01,s radar scre=\\nen.=20\\nEnron commercials continue to appear on business channels such as CNBC and=\\n=20\\nCNNfn, as well as the History Channel, ESPN and network news programs. Some=\\n=20\\nare running in Europe as well.\\n\\nWhile we won\\'t rule out entirely the possibility of directing some of our=\\n=20\\nfuture advertising dollars toward sports events, for now, we believe we are=\\n=20\\nspending our ad budget where it will have the greatest positive impact on o=\\nur=20\\nbusiness.\\n\\nThanks for your suggestion.

TFA has a strong board led by Ken Lay, the CEO\\nof Enron Corporation.  TFA has assisted its affiliates (all believed to\\nbe tax exempt non profits) in building computer learning centers\\n(\"CLC\\'s\") where recycled computers and donated software are connected\\nover the Enron Broadband Network (donated to TFA) to a server farm that\\ndelivers to the disadvantaged at the CLC\\'s educational and other\\ncontent.  There are over 75 CLC\\'s in Houston, some 25 in Colorado and we\\nare building affiliations that will build them across the country and\\neventually all over the world.  The business plan for this contemplates\\noperations in excess of one billion by the end of five years.  However,\\nwe have not yet received our tax determination letter.  We have found\\nthat major contributors require a tax determination letter.\\n\\n    I received a response from the IRS on May 3, 2000.  On May 11, 2000,\\nI responded with answers to the inquiries made by the IRS.  Then on June\\n8 I was advised that our application had been sent to the national\\noffice.  On November 15 I received another letter from the IRS raising\\nsome additional questions unrelated to the first response.  While there\\nwere some that were of substance in the main they were pretty weak.  The\\nfirst question was something like \"What did we mean by disadvantaged?\"\\n\\n    My question to you is what do you think is best to get this going\\nand out of the IRS?  Should I ask our board members to use their\\nconsiderable political influence tocause the IRS to move this?  Back in\\nAugust I had Bill Archer give the Commissioner an invitation to finish\\nthis.  It did not seem to work.  I do not wish for an effort on my part\\nto cause this to go to the bottom of some bureaucrats stack.     Your\\nadvice would be appreciated.\\n\\nRegards:\\n\\nJack Clark',\n",

       " 'Jack:\\n\\n    We routinely work with applications that have been \"sent to the national\\noffice.\"  If an application is \"sent to the national office,\" it means that\\nan issue or issues have been identified in the application by the original\\nreviewing agent that give the agent pause, and which the agent feels a more\\ntechnical review by a more skilled agent is required.  It always means that\\nthere is some problem with the application that could result in denial of the\\napplication.\\n\\n    I suspect that what the IRS would really like your client to do is\\nestablish objective standards in your organization\\'s fundamental documents\\nfor determining who is to receive the assistance of the charity.   Such\\nstandards would give the IRS assurance that only poor people would receive\\nthe benefits, and make it easier to determine if the mission was being\\nadhered to in an audit of activities.  Addressing this concern could be as\\nsimple as enacting a Bylaw amendment or more likely an amendment to the\\nArticles of Incorporation.\\n\\n    Last year, our office was brought in at the \"national office\" stage, well\\nafter the Form 1024 was filed, to help a group of ranchers and cattlemen in\\nWyoming/Montana opposed to illegal imports of below cost beef, to obtain\\ntrade association status, (501(c)(6)), that the national office kept trying\\nto deny by saying they were an agriculture organization (which meant\\npotentially less availability of tax deductible contributions under o162).\\nWhat we did in that case was setup a conference call with the client\\'s\\nlawyers and the IRS national office team assigned to the file.  We talked\\nthrough the application, identified each and every problem the IRS had\\nidentified, and then our firm prepared, in essence, a supplemental brief\\naddressing each issue.  In the process, we learned that a few minor changes\\nto the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, plus the supplemental\\napplication information, were enough to address the IRS\\'s agents concerns,\\nand they issued the tax determination letter.\\n\\n    Thus, I would suggest that you request a conference call with the\\nnational office agent or \"team\" reviewing the application, and get them to\\nidentify each and every concern with the application.   Then, ask them for a\\nperiod of time to respond.  Ask them if changes in the fundamental corporate\\ndocuments would help address their concerns.  And of course, be mindful that\\nif you have had ongoing activities, you will want to be sure that anything\\nyou do will result in retroactive deductibility for what contributions you\\nhave already received.\\n\\n    During late 1999, the IRS was accused of responding to political pressure\\nin triggering audits of exempt organizations by the Landmark Legal\\nFoundation, a conservative, Washington, D.C. legal foundation.  Landmark did\\na Freedom of Information Act request and released documents which tended to\\nindicate that the IRS was auditing groups in response to complaints from\\nCongressmen.  The IRS denied that political influence plays a role in its\\ndecisions, and, since then, the IRS exempt organizations unit has been very\\ncareful about not creating an impression that they respond to political\\npressure.\\n\\n    If your client would like our firm to help as a consultant to work with\\nthe national office, we\\'d be pleased to be of assistance.  We would need to\\nreview the file and have your client execute a Form 2848 Power of Attorney\\nfor us to join the team.\\n\\n    Hope this is helpful.\\n\\nBest regards,\\n\\nJim Lacy\\nWewer & Lacy, LLP\\n\\nCONFIDENTIALITY NOTICE: The information contained in this communication and\\nany\\naccompanying document(s) is protected by the attorney-client and/or the\\nattorney/work product privileges.

       " 'Jim:\\nIt was a pleasure speaking with you on Wednesday.  Based on our conversatio=\\nn,=20\\nthis email includes the following:\\n\\nAn Enron contact to discuss developing small-scale generation on Tribal lan=\\nds.\\n\\nOur views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h=\\now=20\\nto remove those impediments.\\n\\nA description of the credit issues that continue to impede DWR=01,s ability=\\n to=20\\nsign contracts with power suppliers, and options to resolve them. Two=20\\npossible options for addressing the credit issue are 1) a California PUC=20\\norder clarifying that DWR will recover its power purchase costs through=20\\nrates, and 2) an amendment to AB1X designed to accomplish the same goal.  I=\\n=20\\nhave attached talking points regarding the California PUC order and propose=\\nd=20\\namendments to AB1X.  We believe that an amendment to AB1X is the preferable=\\n=20\\noption.\\n\\nOur assessment of the supply/demand picture in California.\\n\\nOur suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near-=\\n=20\\nand long-term electricity crisis in California.  We will deliver to your=20\\noffice today detailed legislative language.

Please do not hesitate to contact m=\\ne=20\\nif you would like to discuss these materials further, or if there is anythi=\\nng=20\\nelse that I can do to assist you.\\n\\nRegards,\\nKen Lay\\n\\n\\n\\nContact Information to Discuss Interest Expressed by Native American Tribes=\\n=20\\nin Installing Small-scale Generation on Tribal Lands\\n\\nDavid Parquet, Vice-President\\nEnron North America\\n101 California Street, Suite 1950\\nSan Francisco, CA 94111\\nPhone: 415.782.7820\\nFax: 415.782.7851\\n\\n\\n2. Key Barriers to Distributed Generation\\n\\nExcessive and Unnecessary Utility Stand-by Charges\\n\\nSolution: The executive orders issued by the Governor on February 14th took=\\n a=20\\nstep in the right direction.  Utility stand-by charges have always been=20\\ndesigned by the utilities to protect their monopoly position, extract=20\\nmonopoly prices from customers, or both.  But there is no reason to limit t=\\nhe=20\\nelimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than=20\\n1MW.  These limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for=\\n=20\\nCalifornia to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc=\\ne=20\\nthe risk of black outs this summer.  We would propose lifting the cap by=20\\noffering amendments to SB27X, which is designed to facilitate development o=\\nf=20\\ndistributed generation.\\n=20\\nExcessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with=20\\ninvestor-owned and municipal utilities\\n\\nSolution:   The Governor=01,s executive order regarding interconnection is =\\na=20\\nstep in the right direction=01*D-D-26-01 requires utilities to complete=20\\ninterconnection studies within 7 days.  California should ensure that this=\\n=20\\nrequirement applies to all generation facilities, including distributed=20\\ngeneration.  In addition, the financial conflicts the utilities face when=\\n=20\\ninterconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome=\\n=20\\nthrough executive orders or other regulations.  To the greatest extent=20\\npossible, California should shift control over interconnection away from th=\\ne=20\\nutility and place that control with the California ISO.  This could be=20\\naccomplished through amendments to SB 27X.\\n\\nPermitting and Air Quality Issues\\nDevelopers of distributed (i.e., =01&on-site=018) generation that is 50 MWs=\\n or=20\\ngreater must receive certification from the California Energy Commission an=\\nd=20\\ntherefore face all of the impediments to development that large-scale=20\\ngeneration faces. =20\\n\\nSolution: California should ensure that the executive orders (D-22-01 thru=\\n=20\\nD-26-01) issued by the Governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant=\\n=20\\noutput apply equally to smaller scale, =01&distributed generation=018 facil=\\nities.=20\\nIn addition, distributed generation that is less than 50 MWs continues to=\\n=20\\nface local opposition.  The State should ensure that local, parochial=20\\ninterests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects=\\n. =20\\nThese objectives could be accomplished through amendments to SB27X.\\n\\n3. Credit Concerns Regarding Authority Granted to DWR in AB1X to Purchase=\\n=20\\nElectricity on Behalf of the Utilities=20\\n\\nEnron responded to the RFP issued by DWR to enter into power contracts with=\\n=20\\nsuppliers.\\nEnron is in active discussions with DWR to establish contract terms with th=\\ne=20\\ngoal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible.\\nHowever, ambiguities contained in AB1X have created significant credit risk=\\n=20\\nconcerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms.\\nWe understand that the lion=01,s share of counterparties share Enron=01,s c=\\nredit=20\\nrisk concerns.\\nEnron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and=\\n=20\\nis working with DWR to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to=\\n=20\\nboth sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements=\\n=20\\ngoing forward.\\n\\nSummary of the Source of the Credit Risk Issue\\n\\nAmbiguous Ratemaking Authority\\nThe language in AB1X is ambiguous as to whether DWR has any authority to=20\\ncharge California ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power.  From our=\\n=20\\nanalysis of the bill, the language in AB1X appears to leave intact the=20\\nCalifornia PUC=01,s exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in California.  =\\nAs=20\\nsuch, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agree to include in rat=\\nes=20\\nadequate charges to cover DWR=01,s costs of power purchases.\\n\\nAmbiguous Regulatory Authority Regarding Contract =01&Prudence=018\\nThe language in AB1X leaves open the possibility that the California Public=\\n=20\\nUtilities Commission could determine that power purchases made by DWR are=\\n=20\\n=01&imprudent.=018  On the basis of such a finding, the CPUC could then ref=\\nuse to=20\\nallow DWR to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power=20\\npurchases.  Consequently, suppliers have no assurance that the PUC will agr=\\nee=20\\nto include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that=\\n=20\\nDWR has entered into with suppliers.\\n=20\\nAmbiguous Language Regarding the Ratemaking Mechanism that Will Be Used to=\\n=20\\nRecover DWR=01,s Costs of Power Purchases\\nIn addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority=\\n=20\\nnoted above, the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to=\\n=20\\nthe specific ratemaking =01&mechanics=018 that AB1X directs the PUC to empl=\\noy to=20\\npermit DWR to recover its power purchase costs. Based on our analysis, it i=\\ns=20\\nextremely difficult to determine how the PUC would design the rates to ensu=\\nre=20\\nDWR recovers its power purchase costs.  Moreover, as currently drafted, it =\\nis=20\\ndifficult to determine whether AB1X would even permit the PUC to include in=\\n=20\\nrates all of the charges necessary to fully recover DWR=01,s power purchase=\\n=20\\ncosts.  Again, this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since=\\n=20\\nsuppliers have little assurance that DWR will have the ability to recover=\\n=20\\nfrom ratepayers the costs of purchasing power.\\n\\nOptions to Resolve Concerns Regarding Credit Risk=20\\n\\nWe have been working diligently with DWR officials to resolve the credit ri=\\nsk=20\\nissues.  We have identified three options:\\n\\nAmend AB1X\\nThe amendments, which are attached to this email, would clarify that a) the=\\n=20\\nPUC would accept as =01&prudent and reasonable=018 all purchase costs incur=\\nred by=20\\nDWR, and b) the PUC is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary =\\nto=20\\nensure that DWR fully recovers its costs of power purchases.  This is the=\\n=20\\npreferred option, though we understand that the there may be some political=\\n=20\\nchallenges standing in the way of amending AB1X.  (See attached file=20\\nentitled, =01&AmendAB1X.doc=018.)\\n\\nClarify the Ambiguities in AB1X through an Order Issued by the PUC, and=20\\nthrough Contract Language\\nThis is the option that we are currently working with DWR officials to=20\\nimplement.  However, it is more complicated and could take significantly mo=\\nre=20\\ntime to implement than the \"legislative\" fix.  We have attached electronic=\\n=20\\ncopies of the talking points related to the order that the California PUC=\\n=20\\nwould need to issue under this option.  (See attached file entitled,=20\\n=01&cpuctalkingpoints.doc.=018)\\n\\nMake Use of Other Instruments Designed to Address Credit Risk\\nAs indicated in our letter responding to DWR=01,s RFP, we are willing to ac=\\ncept=20\\nother forms of credit from DWR.  Those options include a letter of credit,=\\n=20\\ncash prepayment, or an acceptable form of collateral.  DWR officials have=\\n=20\\nindicated to us that DWR prefers to pursue the second options. That is, DWR=\\n=20\\nprefers to clarify the ambiguities in AB1X through a PUC order and through=\\n=20\\ncontract amendments.\\n\\n4. California=01,s Supply-demand Picture Heading into Summer 2001\\n\\nBoth the California Energy Commission and Cambridge Energy Research=20\\nAssociates (CERA), a private sector energy think tank, have issued reports=\\n=20\\nshowing that California faces a severe supply-demand imbalance.  They diffe=\\nr=20\\nonly on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available.  Al=\\nl=20\\ncredible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the Summer=\\n=20\\nof 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately, blackouts are=20\\nlikely. =20\\n\\nCEC and CERA both forecast that California will be short of supply this=20\\nsummer by approximately 5,000 MW.   These numbers are in line with our=20\\nestimates.  California=01,s supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin,=\\n well=20\\nbelow the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio=\\nn=20\\nin the West.  Since the West relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power=\\n=20\\nthan other regions, reserves are particularly important, owing to the=20\\nunpredictability of the weather and the dry year the West has experienced t=\\no=20\\ndate. In the event of a low rain and snow period, the system must possess t=\\nhe=20\\nflexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply. =20\\nCalifornia=01,s very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to =\\nthis=20\\nrequirement. =20\\n\\nOther reasons for reduced supply for the Summer of 2001 include the early=\\n=20\\ndraw-down of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage California\\'s seve=\\nre=20\\nsupply-demand gap; emissions restrictions on existing plants; and a reduced=\\n=20\\nnumber of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the=20\\nutilities.  Cambridge Energy Research Associates asserts that at the curren=\\nt=20\\npace of siting, permitting and construction, adequate supplies will not be=\\n=20\\nadded to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest.\\n\\nCERA predicts that California is likely to face approximately 20 hours of=\\n=20\\nrolling black outs this summer.  The CEC paints a considerably more=20\\noptimistic scenario, betting that California will bring an additional 5,000=\\n=20\\nMWs on line to meet peaking summer demand.  It is our view that California=\\n=20\\nshould view the CEC\\'s \"rosy scenario\" with considerable skepticism.\\n\\n5. Suggested Package of Legislative Proposals Designed to Solve California=\\n=01,s=20\\nElectricity Crisis\\n\\nThis email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution.  We wil=\\nl=20\\ndeliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing=\\n=20\\nbills that we believe can accommodate our proposals.\\n\\nAs we have suggested throughout the crisis, any solution to California\\'s=20\\ncrisis must focus on four issues:\\n\\nIncrease supply\\nDecrease demand\\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market\\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency\\n\\nIncrease supply--Legislative vehicle: SB28X (Sher)\\nTo site and construct a power plant in Texas takes approximately 2 years. =\\n=20\\nEnron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less=\\n=20\\nthan a year.  In California, it takes about six years, or longer.\\n\\nThe Governor=01,s executive orders and Senator Sher=01,s siting reform legi=\\nslation=20\\nare steps in the right direction.  Our suggested amendments can improve tho=\\nse=20\\nefforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face=\\n=20\\nin securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit=20\\nrequirements included in the CEC\\'s certification requirements.  Enron=01,s=\\n=20\\nproposal seeks to streamline the process for 1) obtaining credits and 2)=20\\ntransfering credits between air districts.  In addition, it creates an=20\\ninnovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund=20\\nemissions in advance of obtaining certification, and permits the affected a=\\nir=20\\ndistricts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the=20\\nrequired reductions in pollution emissions.\\n\\nDecrease demand=01*Legislative Vehicle:   AB31X (Wright)\\nBecause of the delay in getting a solution in place in California, closing=\\n=20\\nthe supply-demand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the=\\n=20\\nbest chance of avoiding blackouts this summer.  This can be accomplished mo=\\nst=20\\neffectively and quickly in two ways:\\n\\nBuy-down demand\\nCalifornia is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the General Fun=\\nd=20\\nto finance DWR=01,s power purchases.  California could likely reduce demand=\\n more=20\\neconomically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou=\\nld=20\\nbe willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period (e.g.,=\\n=20\\nthrough the summer months).  DWR could easily run an on-line auction to=20\\ndetermine the price it could pay for these demand reductions.  To=20\\nparticipate, businesses would be required to have the metering equipment=20\\nnecessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the=20\\nreductions.  Enron has developed an on-line auction software package, =01&D=\\neal=20\\nBench,=018 that it would be willing to contribute to the effort.\\n\\nUse Price Signals to Incent Voluntary Curtailment\\nTo be successful, customers need access to the following key elements:\\n\\nAn internet based hour-ahead price posting system to track the market price=\\n=20\\nfor hour-ahead power in real time.=20\\nReal-time metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment=\\n=20\\nverification.\\nSettlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be=\\n=20\\npaid for load reduction (=01&Negawatts=018).\\n\\nThe potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ=\\ne:\\n\\n=01&creation=018 of additional summer peaking capacity in California, parti=\\ncularly=20\\nin the short term, without requiring construction of additional generation=\\n=20\\nresources.\\nreduction of  peak or super-peak load on the over-stressed California=20\\nelectric system, thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity =\\nin=20\\nthe state.\\nfostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris=\\nk=20\\nof hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to=20\\ncustomers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for=\\n=20\\nresponding.=20\\n\\nWe estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 on-peak demand response in=\\n=20\\nexcess of 400 MW during certain high cost hours, and a demand response for=\\n=20\\nsummer 2002 on-peak hours that could exceed 1000 MW.  We further estimate=\\n=20\\nthat the market response to this program from all ESPs could be 2 to 3 time=\\ns=20\\nthat amount.  We recommend that the State of California provide rebates=20\\ndirectly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and=20\\ncontrol systems that would support load curtailment implementation.\\n\\nEstablish a truly competitive retail electricity market=01*Legislative vehi=\\ncle:=20\\nSB27X\\nThe only customers who were protected from price volatility in San Diego we=\\nre=20\\ncustomers who chose Direct Access and signed fixed price deals with energy=\\n=20\\nservice providers.  Ironically, AB1X takes that important option away from=\\n=20\\ncustomers and businesses.  It is critical that AB1X be amended to remove th=\\ne=20\\nprohibition against Direct Access.\\n\\nEnron\\'s legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a=\\n=20\\ndirect access transaction, while simultaneously addressing the Department o=\\nf=20\\nWater Resources\\' concerns about stranded power costs that might result from=\\n=20\\ncustomer migration. =20\\n\\nIn addition, California will only achieve a competitive retail market when=\\n=20\\nthe utility is removed completely from the procurement function.  Procureme=\\nnt=20\\nis not a utility core competency, as evidenced by the dire financial=20\\ncondition in which the utilities now find themselves.  California should=20\\ntherefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement=20\\nfunction entirely, with the goal of having all customers served by a=20\\nnon-utility provider within 36 months.  To execute the transition, Californ=\\nia=20\\nshould hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36-month period =\\nin=20\\nwhich competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments=\\n=20\\nof utility load.\\n\\nReturn California=01,s Investor-owned utilities to solvency=01*Legislative =\\nvehicle:=20\\nAB18X\\nUtility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand=\\n. =20\\nIn short, bankruptcy does nothing to solve California=01,s supply-demand=20\\nimbalance.  In addition, bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers=\\n=20\\nand businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having Californ=\\nia=20\\nState government assume the role of =01&electricity buyer=018 for an extend=\\ned=20\\nperiod of time.  Finally, bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidenc=\\ne=20\\nin California\\'s energy markets and the private sector\\'s willingness to=20\\nparticipate in that market.\\n\\nCalifornia can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a=\\n=20\\nseries of staged rate increases.  California should design those rate=20\\nincreases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without=\\n=20\\n=01&shocking=018 the economy or household budgets For example, California c=\\nould=20\\namortize the recovery of the utilities=01, past debt over a 5-10 year perio=\\nd. =20\\nIn addition, the magnitude of the rate increase can be reduced in two ways:=\\n=20\\nFirst, the utilities could absorb some portion of their existing debt in=20\\nrecognition of the risk they accepted when they agreed to the structure of =\\nAB=20\\n1890.  Second, California can =01&net=018 the revenues the utilities have r=\\neceived=20\\nfrom selling electricity into the Power Exchange against the debts they hav=\\ne=20\\naccrued due to the retail price cap.\\n\\n ',\n",

As a result oil prices pushed\\nslightly higher with NYMEX crude trading at $26.80 and IPEC crude trading at\\n25.06. OPEC ministers have indicated that members have highlighted $25/bbl\\nas a price that they feel comfortable with.The decreases per country were as\\nfollows:\\n\\nAlgeria - 32,000\\nIndonesia - 52,000\\nIran - 146,000\\nKuwait - 80,000\\nLibya - 54,000\\nNigeria - 82,000\\nQatar - 26,000\\nSaudi Arabia - 324,000\\nUAE - 88,000\\nVenezuela - 116,000\\nTotal - 1,000,000\\n\\n\\nENERGY AFRICA LOOK TOWARD THE MOROCCAN DEEP\\nRabat - This week the MENA Petroleum Bulletin spoke with Andrew Windham,\\nGroup General Counsel for Energy Africa. Amina Benkhadra, General Manager of\\nONAREP (25%) added to the growing list of re-entrants to Morocco, signing a\\npetroleum agreement with Energy Africa (63.75%) and Taurus Petroleum AB\\n(11.25%). This agreement, taking effect March 1st 2001, concerned three\\nexploration permits offshore Morocco collectively known as the Tiznit\\nOffshore area.\\nEnergy Africa Morocco Ltd (operator), together with Taurus Petroleum\\n(co-partner) will implement exploration work on the three permits of the\\nTiznit Offshore area covering approximately 6000sq.km. This is Energy\\nAfrica\\'s second Petroleum Agreement covering acreage offshore Morocco, the\\nfirst being the Cap Draa Haute Mer area where Energy Africa holds 20% equity\\nbringing the total acreage held by it in the country to 18,000sq.km.\\nAndrew Windham, said, \\'the country has all the characteristics offshore\\nwhich make potentially, for substantial discoveries. But at this stage it is\\nvery much untried and untested, so it is a very exciting place to be at the\\nmoment. We are in right at the start of some new plays.\\'\\nFor further details please see the April issue of the MENA Petroleum\\nBulletin.\\n\\n\\nREPSOL MAKE 2ND LIBYA DISCOVERY\\nLondon - Repsol YPF SA said it discovered oil at a second well during\\nexploration in Libya. The well in the Murzuq Basin, 800km south of Tripoli,\\nproduced oil at a rate of 1,300bbl/d, the company said in a press release.\\nRepsol is testing the site on behalf of a consortium including OMV,\\nTotalFinaElf and Saga Petroleum. Repsol began searching for oil in the area\\nin May 1998, when the Libyan government granted approval for exploration and\\nproduction sharing arrangements with foreign companies. The companies\\ncurrently produce more than 160,000bbl/d from the Murzuq Basin, said the\\ncompany.\\n\\n\\nAHMED ABDELKARIM CONFIRMED AS NEW HEAD OF NOC\\nTripoli - Further to reports this week from Libya Ahmed Abdel-Karim Ahmed\\nhas been formally appointed as Chairman of NOC, following reports that he\\nhad been removed from the position. Representing Libya at the OPEC\\nconference in Geneva it was confirmed that Al-Badri has been appointed as\\nDeputy Prime Minister for Social Security. The news will comfort foreign\\ninvestors who feared that further upheaval would hinder an already slow\\nratification process, with approvals outstanding for three packages of\\nblocks offered by NOC in late 2000.\\n\\n\\n\\n*******SPECIAL FEATURES FOR 2001******\\n\\nThe MENA Petroleum Bulletin is to initiate rankings and league tables for\\nthe top suppliers to the oil and gas sector.

Pursuant to those\\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay\\'s office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area on\\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\\n\\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay\\'s\\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay\\'s staff on all these matters.\\n\\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and advise\\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before or\\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\\n\\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies to\\nattend the dinner.\\n\\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at a\\nboard member\\'s home nearby.\\n\\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\\nany questions you may have.  Thank you.\\n\\nAnne Culver\\nSr. VP, Government Relations\\nGreater Houston Partnership\\n713/844-3624 (ph)\\n713/844-0224 (fax)\\naculver@houston.org\\n\\nVisit our website at www.houston.org\\n\\n\\n',\n",

The report finds that energy efficiency for buildings,\\ntransportation, and industry could account for more than half of the\\npotential greenhouse gas reductions achievable by 2020. Natural gas\\ntechnologies, more efficient power plant technologies, and combined heat an=\\nd\\npower play an important role in reducing fossil energy power plant\\nemissions. And \"low-carbon energy systems,\" such as renewable energy, can\\nalso make an important contribution.

The origins of the gap are claimed to lie in a\\nseries of barriers, such as lack of capital, lack of information or hidden\\ncosts, which prevent markets for energy and energy-using technologies from\\noperating efficiently.  SPRU says that understanding the size and nature of\\nthis gap is essential if policies to mitigate climate change through\\nimproved energy efficiency are to be successful.

This area accounts for almost 50,000 housing starts a year, more\\nthan are built in 42 states.  One of the main reasons for adopting the code\\nis the area\\'s commitment to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions as part of the\\nTexas state plan for controlling smog.  Since the IECC contains a new\\nstandard for reducing window solar heat gain, which reduces air conditionin=\\ng\\nenergy use substantially, it cuts NOx emissions from the power plants that\\nserve the air conditioning load.  The Alliance supported Public Citizen, th=\\ne\\nTexas Building Energy Institute, the Sustainable Living Alliance, NCTCOG\\nstaff, and others in this effort, working with the Building Codes Assistanc=\\ne\\nProject and Alliance Associates.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAlliance Associates Honored with Awards\\n\\nMany Alliance Associates were honored at the 2001 Energy Star Awards\\nCeremony, hosted by the US Environmental Protection Agency and the\\nDepartment of Energy.

Pursuant to those\\nmeetings, Mr. DeLay\\'s office has asked for some follow-up meetings to be\\nheld in Houston on Friday, April 6th.   He intends to travel to this area\\non\\nthat day along with, and as host to, Congressman Barton (R-Texas, Chairman\\nof the Energy and Power Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and\\nCommerce) and with Congressman Billy Tauzin (R-Louisiana, Chairman, House\\nCommittee on Energy and Commerce).    The Energy and Commerce Committee has\\noversight over Clean Air Act matters.  DeLay has requested support from and\\ninteraction with the BCCA and the Partnership on that day.\\n\\nAPRIL 6TH ACTIVITY  After time spent early in the day in Mr. DeLay\\'s\\ncongressional district to meet with Brazoria and Fort Bend County local\\nofficials, Mr. DeLay has asked us to then pick up the itinerary with a ship\\nchannel tour and presentations on SIP status, science and modeling issues.\\nWe are working closely with Mr. DeLay\\'s staff on all these matters.\\n\\nHe has asked to end the day with a \"small dinner with CEOs\" to have a frank\\ndiscussion about our clean air issues.  This is the dinner my staff called\\nyour office about on Friday.  Clearly, Mr. DeLay is interested in what he\\nand the other congressmen may be able to due legislatively to assist in\\naddressing some of the issues we have with the SIP.   He has asked that we\\nalso invite Governor Perry to attend the dinner, which we are doing.  Mr.\\nDeLay will call the Governor to encourage his attendance.  This will\\nobviously be a critical opportunity to relay targeted information and\\nadvise\\non strategy with key members of Congress and the Governor.  Everyone in\\nattendance at the dinner will be provided coordinated talking points in\\nadvance.  There may also be a formal briefing arranged immediately before\\nor\\nafter the April 3 Partnership Board meeting so we can prep in advance.\\n\\nRSVPs TO DATE  Responses so far indicate that Steve Miller, Ed Galante, Jim\\nEdmonds and Jim Kollaer are confirmed to attend the dinner.  Charles Duncan\\nand Kelly Frels are checking calendars.  Ken Lay, Steve Letbetter and Dan\\nSmith are unavailable.  We do not have a commitment yet from the Governor.\\nWe will likely recruit two or three other CEOs from BCCA member companies\\nto\\nattend the dinner.\\n\\nMy current thought is to house the members of Congress at the St. Regis and\\nto arrange the dinner either at the River Oaks Country Club or possibly at\\na\\nboard member\\'s home nearby.\\n\\nI trust this additional information is useful to you.  I will be the\\nPartnership point person on this -- please do not hesitate to call me with\\nany questions you may have.

(NASDAQ: INTU\\n> <http://www.quicken.com/investments/quotes/?symbol=INTU>) announced today\\n> that its board of directors has selected Stephen M. Bennett as president\\n> and chief executive officer. Bennett assumes his responsibilities\\n> immediately, succeeding Bill Campbell, who had been acting chief executive\\n> since September. Campbell is retiring from day-to-day responsibilities but\\n> will remain chairman of the board of directors. Bennett was also named to\\n> the board.\\n> Bennett, 45, was most recently an executive vice president and member of\\n> the Office of the CEO at GE Capital, the financial services subsidiary of\\n> General Electric Corp. GE Capital is the world leader in numerous\\n> financial industries, including private label credit cards, commercial\\n> equipment leasing and vendor finance. With $330 billion in assets, GE\\n> Capital provides 42% of General Electric\\'s overall profits and is among\\n> the world\\'s largest non-banking financial institutions.\\n> \"Steve is an outstanding leader from a company renowned for strong\\n> leadership,\" said Campbell. \"His experience is tailor-made to fit Intuit\\'s\\n> needs now and in the future. We wanted someone with service industry\\n> knowledge, who had led large, complex organizations and with proven\\n> ability to produce fast growth. Steve is the ideal choice to take Intuit\\n> to the multi-billion dollar level.\"\\n> \"Intuit is the leader in e-finance. Quicken.com is already the leader in\\n> online tax preparation and online mortgage origination,\" said Bennett, who\\n> will relocate from Connecticut to the Bay Area. \"I\\'m excited to have the\\n> opportunity to continue developing services for the Internet and take\\n> Intuit\\'s industry leadership to new heights.\"\\n> During his GE career, Bennett held significant leadership positions in six\\n> different businesses within the company, spanning both manufacturing and\\n> financial services. In his most recent position, he oversaw a portfolio of\\n> five different companies whose more than 20,000 employees last year\\n> generated $15 billion in annual volume. Prior to that, as president and\\n> CEO of GE Capital e-Business, he pioneered the company\\'s efforts to\\n> leverage the Internet across GE Capital\\'s worldwide portfolio of\\n> businesses.\\n> Previously he delivered significant growth as the president and CEO of GE\\n> Capital\\'s more than 4,000-employee Vendor Financial Services business.\\n> Under his leadership, assets grew to more than $13 billion from $5 billion\\n> and net income increased to $200 million from $80 million in four years.\\n> Intuit board member John Doerr said he was impressed by Bennett\\'s broad\\n> base of experience. \"Steve knows business-to-business as well as\\n> business-to-consumer. He knows service businesses.

I\\'m glad\\n> to have the opportunity to lead Intuit\\'s continued growth and expansion.\"\\n> Scott Cook, Intuit founder and chairman of its executive committee, said,\\n> \"Steve shares Intuit\\'s values.

As discussed, he is to chair the first of\\ntwo energy panels at the FORUM; his is titled \"Fuelling Sustainable\\nDevelopment\".  On his panel will be Mr Kurt Yeager of EPRI (speaking on\\nhydrocarbon issues), Mr Luis Echavarri, the head of the OECD\\'s Nuclear\\nEnergy Agency (speaking on nuclear power), and Danish Minister of Energy and\\nEnvironment, Svend Auken (speaking on renewables and energy efficiency).\\nThe panel is scheduled to take place starting at 3pm at the Cit, des\\nSciences et de l\\'Industrie, in La Villete, in northern Paris.\\n\\nAs I believe I noted in our previous e-mail communications, while the IEA is\\nresponsible for organising our ministerial session and the substantive\\nissues related to the energy panels on the FORUM, the OECD is doing the\\nFORUM logistics.  They have therefore asked that I forward to all speakers\\nthe following note (see below). It asks that Mr Lay provide a number of\\nlogistical inputs, including a biography and photo, as well as information\\non any remarks he might choose to make. I note that as the chair of the\\nfirst energy panel, he may not wish to make a formal presentation -- but\\ntime does permit this if he wishes, and the decision is at his discretion.\\nI would appreciate being a cc on any material you send to the OECD so we can\\nkeep our files current.\\n\\nOn our own side, the IEA concluded its Governing Board Meeting last Friday,\\nand finally approved the ministerial session agenda and arrangements.  While\\nMr Priddle will be sending out a formal invitation and set of background\\ndocuments to Mr Lay this week, I wanted to give you a heads up and find out\\nif you had any \"last-minute\" questions which I might help answer.\\n\\nIn addition, I note that your last e-mail indicated Mrs Lay will be in Paris\\nduring our session.  Some of our ministerial representatives are also\\nplanning to bring spouses (in particular US Energy Secretary Abraham, who is\\ncoming with his wife) -- do you think Mrs Lay might wish to participate in\\nany events during this period with any of these others?  If you let us know,\\nwe would be happy to make arrangements.\\n\\nAlso, please let us know if others will be travelling with Mr Lay, and if we\\nmight facilitate their logistics.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing from you.\\n\\nBest wishes,\\n\\nJonathan Pershing\\n\\n________________________\\nJonathan C.

The Plaintiff\\ncan recover for all legal fees he incurs in bringing the lawsuit.\\nDerivative actions commonly follow class action filings, as a sort of\\n\"tag-along\" type of action.\\n\\nThe Plaintiff attorney has requested that i2 accept service of the lawsuit\\non your behalf.  Normally, I would say no and let the Plaintiff law firm\\ntry and track you down, but they may try and serve you at an inappropriate\\ntime, i.e. client meeting, during a speech.  Please let me know if you\\nwould like for us to accept service on your behalf.  This is very common\\npractice.\\n\\nI will send each of you a copy of the lawsuit.  Needless to say, you are\\nindemnified for this, i2 will pay for all legal fees incurred to defend you\\nand i2 does have insurance to cover this matter.\\n\\nPlease let me know of your decision to have i2 accept service on your\\nbehalf.\\n\\nThanks\\n\\n\\nBob Donohoo\\nCorporate Counsel\\ni2 Technologies, Inc.\\n\\nThis message and the documents attached to it, if any, is intended only for\\nthe use of the addressee and may contain information that may be PRIVILEGED\\nand CONFIDENTIAL, and/or may contain ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT.

The USOC will be conducting\\nHouston's site visit July 16-19, 2001.\\n\\nThis site visit is critical to our ultimate success in bringing the Olympic\\nGames to Houston.

I have spoken with Hardie (who\\nalso edited this letter for me) and we both agree that this would have much\\ngreater impact if it came directly from you, as a past Father of the Year.\\nAs you can see we attributed the information about our shortfall directly\\nto me, so I am involved in the letter but not doing the solicitation.  If\\nyou are not comfortable with this, just let me know and I will redo the\\nletter.  I think if you agree to send this out over your signature it would\\nbe enormously helpful.  Please let me know what you\\'d like me to do.\\n\\n  Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and continuous support.\\n\\n    Donna\\n - KLay2000request.doc\\n\\n',\n",

I also spoke with Rocky about how  they arrive at their loan \\nto value calculations and he is going to have me talk  with the person in \\nthat department to walk me through it.? Regardless of  how much that number \\nmoves, I told Sherrie that you would like to know where it  stands at the \\ntime she provides the information for all of the other  lines.? I told her \\nthat we should have that updated once a  week.\\n?\\nI also?thought it would be good?within  the?partnership to borrow against the \\nPW accounts, which include Fayez,  Cypress, Eagle, and Harris Bretall for \\nsome of these private investments.?  The combined gross value is at $2.5 \\nmillion so that would allow for an  additional $1.25 million to be borrowed \\nat 50% loan to value.? It may be a  higher number, but with a small cushion \\nthat is probably a good estimate.?  I talked to Rocky about this and he said \\nit would be no problem and he would  give us the same rate 70 basis points.\\n?\\nWith regards to rates and the PW/UBS merger, Rocky  said that he thinks that \\nhe can get our borrowing rate down from 70 basis points  plus LIBOR to 20 \\nbasis points plus LIBOR come this November when the merger is  completed.\\n?\\nI have Rocky working on much better reports, like  that which was provided to \\nbe by Mueller/O'Shaughnessy at MSDW.?

Totally unexpected & \\nunsolicited, an offer was accepted; all seemed well as this Recruit got good \\nfeedback directly from clients & Enron upper mgmt.  But after a short time, \\nsuddenly Recruit was told that performance was unsatisfactory.  No specific \\nbehaviors or problems were identified as cause; no opportunity given to \\nmodify; Recruit was summarily removed to another floor with instructions to \\nfind another job.  Upon displacement she told me (~6 weeks ago), \"I want \\navoid trouble for anyone; I just want to continue quietly at Enron and forget \\nthis.\"  \\n\\nTo date I have honored her request for silence, but all this hullabaloo about \\nEnron being the best place to work makes her dilemma particularly upsetting, \\nand there is ample evidence that her plight is not unique.  I refer here to \\nCindy Adams, formerly of Joe Sutton\\'s office.  I don\\'t care why it was \\ndecided not to use HR\\'s counseling/review process designed to help when \\nthings go awry; I just know that Enron\\'s best bet is to give this talented \\nprofessional more time.  She writes:\\n\\n...Last week, my HR Rep informed me that I have a deadline of July 15th in \\nwhich to find a job...I have no assistance from HR or Recruiting.  I had 2 \\ninterviews 5 weeks ago and I had to initiate those myself.  I\\'ve not received \\nanswers from postings I\\'ve responded to - I am left hanging without \\nacknowledgment of any sort.\\n\\nI have been approached and learned from others that the same thing happened \\nto them with the same circumstances; one said that it took her a full 3 \\nmonths to land her present job.  I am not afforded that opportunity now ...\\n\\nJeff, would you please ask someone to remove Cindy\\'s July 15 deadline?  There \\nare no rules left to break here; Cindy is trying to proceed diligently & \\ndiscreetly, but she is under duress by not having any feedback/support from \\nHR.   With a little boost, it\\'s not too late to bring this picture into line \\nwith Enron\\'s vision of retaining topnotch people.  \\n\\nCindy has no idea that I\\'m writing on her behalf, and after this I intend to \\nhonor her wishes with silence.  But you must see the irony here, not to \\nmention the double standard in how Enron\\'s Visions & Values are applied to \\nassistants all over Enron:  Cindy Adams was sought after, then abruptly put \\nout of the office of Joe Sutton, who happens to be our V&V expert!  I\\'m not \\nblaming Joe for anything; he is simply the backdrop in this example.  I \\nremember Joe once used an expression at a floor meeting:  \"believing your own \\nbaloney.\"  He wasn\\'t talking about Visions & Values then, but \"believing \\nbaloney\" suddenly seems to fit for assistants who work at Enron.  You asked \\nfor candid; herein I have done my very best to give it to you.\\n\\nJeff, thanks for asking and listening.  I and my colleagues are listening \\ntoo, but seeing is believing.\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\n\\nBetty Alexander\\nSr. Administrative Assistant \\n',\n",

       " \"As I promised this morning at the executive committee meeting, below are some \\ntalking points for your use.\\n\\nOverall message:  the market is working, regulation is not.\\n\\nIn California, peak demand rose by 10% over the last 4 years while new \\ncapacity grew by only 2%.  But, as you would expect, the market responded by \\nproposing 8,000MW of new generation - - more than enough to offset the peak \\ndemand growth.  The regulatory process, at both the state and local level, \\nhas failed to site this new generation.  The problem is regulation, not \\nderegulation.\\n\\nWhen San Diego customers began experiencing the effects of higher prices, \\nEnron responded with a fixed price which would have shielded San Diego \\ncustomers from price volatility and provided prices below their current \\nsummer levels (Enron's price was about $55/MWH).  After publication of \\nEnron's offer, nine other companies made offers.  Again, the market responded \\nwhere regulation failed.  San Diego has not accepted any of these offers \\nbecause of regulatory/legislative restrictions on its ability to buy outside \\nof the PX (i.e. the spot market).\\n\\nIn markets where siting is easier, suppliers have moved to build additional \\ngeneration.  Enron built 3 plants in response to the 1998 price spikes.  \\nThose plants were planned, sited and built in less that 12 months - - in time \\nfor the summer of 1999.  Where regulatory hurdles are lower, the market \\nresponds.\\n\\nThe solution to current pricing and reliability issues is more competition \\nnot reregulation.  Policy makers should:\\n\\nOpen the transmission grid so that power can get from where it is to where it \\nis needed.\\n\\nExpedite interconnection of new generation.\\n\\nExpedite siting of new facilities.\\n\\nGive customers a choice, so that they have better access to demand side \\nsolutions.\\n\\n\\nAlso attached is a more detailed discussion of California, prepared by Jeff \\nDasovich of our San Francisco office.\\n\",\n",

Mr. Peters will help set the theme \\nby discussing the need for successful companies to reinvent themselves.  Mr. \\nHamil will present tactical strategies for innovation.

       " 'Dear Ken,\\n\\nI thought you might enjoy this summary article on VOD from one of our\\nindustry magazines.  Enron is mentioned but not interviewed so I didn\\'t know\\nif you would have access to a copy.\\n\\nTake care,\\nMary Elizabeth\\n\\nLink to article:\\n\\nhttp://www.cvmag.com/contents/2000/0814/vod814.asp\\n\\nCut and paste:\\nVideo on the Move\\nDropping costs and rising competition are forcing operators to see\\nvideo-on-demand in a whole new light\\nBY SIMON APPLEBAUM\\nAt VOD programmer Diva, the deployment forecast gets more specific, as does\\nthe rationale behind why operators will push the action. Three factors come\\ninto play:\\n* DBS penetration continues to fly and bite off operators\\' best customers;\\n* the plunging expense of video-server hardware and video-stream\\ntransmissions, which make moot the big, prohibitive load operators have used\\nto justify not deploying VOD;\\n* the fallout from Time Warner\\'s deal to merge with America Online --\\nnamely, considerable encouragement to accelerate plans in every other\\nconvergence direction they want to travel, be it digital cable services\\n(including near-VOD and tiers), high-speed Web surfing through cable modems,\\nor interactive TV.\\nThus with cost and infrastructure concerns put aside, and competition\\nstaring them in the face, operators see VOD in a new light. Now that DBS\\nreaches 13 million subs \"and is heading for 20 million, cable is feeling the\\npain,\" says Diva president David Zucker. \"Every one of the eight largest\\ncable operators, every single one, will deploy or trial VOD in some manner.\\nThe big rollouts will start the second half of the year.\" If they come, they\\nmay hear another set of competitive footsteps entering the scene. Digital\\nsubscriber line carriers such as SBC and Qwest, hunting for high-speed\\nInternet households, are poised to reach out and become must-see VOD TV\\nthrough Viacom subsidiary Blockbuster. With infrastructure help from Enron\\nBroadband Services, Blockbuster will deploy a movies-driven VOD service in a\\nnumber of cities by December, and all over the U.S. next year. The joint\\nventure will go after cable and DBS distribution, but off the bat, DSL will\\nbe in the driver\\'s seat, as routed through SBC, Qwest and other suppliers.\\nBut right now, reality is nowhere near the perception Jacobsen and Zucker\\nsuggest. Few multi-system owners have VOD formats fully deployed or in\\ntrial; most MSOs don\\'t, even though they are deep in digital-service\\nlaunches incorporating near-VOD, which takes up 30 channels or more of a\\nsystem\\'s lineup. Video-on-demand, on the other hand, uses far fewer channels\\nthan NVOD, because video servers, placed at or near the system\\'s headend,\\nstore the programming and transmit it on addressable command from\\nsubscribers, any time, over streaming transmissions. How high is the payoff\\nfor mass cable adoption? Try 40 to 60 percent, by 2010, of the multi-billion\\ndollar revenue pot home-video companies enjoy now, predicted Merrill Lynch\\nsenior media analyst Jessica Reif-Cohen at the recent Myers interactive-TV\\nforum in New York.\\nWhere the Action Is\\nYou need more than one hand to count the number of VOD projects happening\\naround the country, but you don\\'t need many more. Here\\'s the scorecard:\\n * Diva - VOD\\'s veteran packager is doing full-deployment business in at\\nleast 10 areas. Affiliates include AT&T Broadband in Marin County, Calif.\\n(outside San Francisco) and Atlanta (formerly MediaOne turf); Charter\\nCommunications in the Atlanta suburbs; and a growing number of Insight\\nCommunications locales (Columbus, Ohio; Rockford, Ill.; and Evansville,\\nInd.) where VOD is bundled with Source Media\\'s Local Source interactive-TV\\nservice. Before Labor Day, Charter will add Diva to at least one of its Los\\nAngeles-area systems. More than 400 titles, from movie blockbusters to\\nspecial-interest videos, are available each month. Top films go for $3.95 a\\npop, while classic flicks and other titles get priced at $2.95 or below.\\nAvailable attractions include library shows from ESPN, TNT, Discovery and\\nother cable nets. About 15,000 subs use the service at least once a month.\\n * Time Warner - Cable\\'s second-largest operator is in full VOD blast,\\nfollowing a trial run in Austin, Texas, last summer. Honolulu became the\\nfirst Time Warner locale to make VOD available system-wide earlier this\\nyear, covering about 250,000 subs. Tampa, Fla., turned on in June, according\\nto Concurrent Computer, which provides servers and streaming tech to Time\\nWarner. About 100,000 Tampa-area subs are getting their day in the VOD sun.\\n* Intertainer - After two years of development and tests, the VOD player\\nthat includes Microsoft, Comcast, NBC, Sony and Intel among its equity\\nstakeholders will soon premiere in Comcast\\'s suburban Baltimore system. That\\nfollows DSL rollouts in U S West\\'s Denver enterprise and Cincinnati under an\\nindependent franchiser. The service has plenty of interactive features to\\naccompany the content, including opportunities to order an artist\\'s CD after\\nwatching his music video; local information retrieval; and e-commerce\\nchoices. Intertainer CEO Jonathan Taplin promises a \"stunning\"\\nMSO-affiliation announcement over the next few weeks.\\n* In Demand - PPV\\'s kingpin player was already talking to affiliates about\\nVOD rollouts and trials when new president Stephen Brenner assumed his post\\nearlier this summer (see sidebar, p. 30).\\n* TVN - In Demand\\'s closest PPV/NVOD rival, whose affiliate base consists of\\nmid-size and small system owners, is in the midst of several VOD technical\\nand marketing trials. Some rollout announcements are expected early this\\nfall. Like Diva and Intertainer, TVN wants to combine programming with\\ninteractive applications.\\n * DemandVideo - This California-based firm surfaced this spring, initially\\non a quest for cable overbuilder affiliates so that they wouldn\\'t be absent\\nfrom VOD activity. Seren Innovations (which runs its systems under Astound\\nCable TV) and Knology signed up before the National Cable TV Association\\nconvention, and Seren put Demand\\'s format through a 25-home trial in St.\\nCloud, Minn. But at NCTA\\'s show in May, Demand CEO Rajiv Juluria insisted\\nthat his product will be available to all comers, entrenched or encroacher.\\nKnology will launch the service among hotels in Panama City, Fla., while\\nSeren commits to a full St. Cloud rollout, plus deployment in Contra Costa\\nCounty, Calif.\\n* E-Video TV - A new VOD player out of Scottsdale, Ariz., E-Video has\\ndeveloped download technology through which digital cable subs can retrieve\\nfeature films, programming and interactive games. Roy Bennett, E-Video\\'s\\npresident, says his firm will try the process out with a cable operator\\nbefore summer ends.\\nUp ahead in the player pipeline: StreamBox and AlwaysonTV.com, two ventures\\nrunning both video and Internet content. Both exhibited two months ago at\\nStreaming Media East in New York. Within VOD\\'s own tech vendordom --\\ncompanies that provide video servers and program-insertion gear to operators\\n-- there\\'s growing consensus that the on-demand era launches this fall. How\\nfast VOD takes off is more in the hands of set-top box providers than MSOs,\\nbelieves Concurrent CEO Steve Nussrallah. The sooner they flood the scene\\nwith digital converters, the sooner deployments happen.  \"We\\'re at the front\\ndoor of an explosion. Late fall or early next year is the right time for\\nthis market to happen,\" he says. \"The only thing holding the market back is\\nthe ability of set-top vendors to build and ship their product at a level\\nequal to the demand. By the end of 2004, we should be north of 30 million\\ndigital set-tops, with the vast majority of them VOD-enabled. Deployment by\\noperators becomes a no-brainer.\" AOL Time Warner will push operators into\\ndeployment decisions, adds nCube president Michael Pohl. \"The convergence of\\nTime Warner\\'s content with the broadband opportunities AOL looks at will\\ndrive the content and availability of content for VOD,\" Pohl suggests.\\n\"Movies are OK and great, probably a good place to start, but ultimately,\\nviewers want to go to their operator and ask for whatever they want to see.\"\\n\"You see the operators showing excitement for VOD now, as opposed to the\\nvendors showing excitement, which is what it was for the last few years,\"\\nsays Yvette Gordon, interactive technologies VP at SeaChange Technologies.\\n\"The AOL-Time Warner merger helps.\"\\nThe Naysayers\\nBut many people don\\'t buy it. Take Playboy Television -- they\\'re supplying\\nproduct to selected Diva and Time Warner VOD markets. They\\'re in the game,\\nbut Playboy TV president Jim English doesn\\'t look for a breakout market\\nuntil 2002. Why? Despite big declines in server cost, \"you need so many per\\nstate, so many per [sub universe],\" English reasons. \"The more subs on the\\nline, the slower the traffic goes. It\\'s still very expensive electronics.\\nI\\'m not trying to poke holes at anyone, but a lot of projections about this\\nindustry didn\\'t come out as advertised. How many years did it take for\\ndigital cable to move? Even now, operators have more trucks dedicated to\\ninstalling high-speed cable modems than digital cable. And on cable\\'s agenda\\npriority scale, just getting the digital box in is number one.\" For\\nSusquehanna Communications and Classic Cable, 2001 is the year VOD will make\\nit to their systems, provided the tech issues English raises get resolved.\\nAs big as the case is for getting economics down enough for deployment among\\nlarge MSOs, it\\'s magnified several times over for owners the size of\\nSusquehanna and Classic.  \"Insight, for example, can serve tens or hundreds\\nof thousands of customers from a single headend. The best we can do is 7,000\\ncustomers from a single headend. For the small, non-metro markets we\\nservice, how do you amortize the cost for initial equipment installation?\"\\nasks Classic CEO Merritt Belisle. \"When you take into account the\\nflexibility and long-term viability of the tech, and different content\\navenues, there\\'s a lot that\\'s nascent and in development,\" responds Dan\\nTemplain, Susquehanna\\'s corporate marketing/programming director. \"The\\ncontent and the tech have to become compelling enough to consumers that\\nwe\\'re willing to roll it out.\" Still, Templain\\'s company is determined to do\\na field trial somewhere this fall, and get deployment underway before the\\nend of next March. \"That\\'s accelerated thinking from where we were six\\nmonths ago.\" To SVOD or Not to SVOD? On the programming side, the train\\neveryone wants to be aboard is making VOD a diverse medium, perhaps to the\\npoint where the medium should be relabeled \"COD\" -- for content-on-demand.\\nMovies, available at or earlier than home-video release, lead the way, but\\nnot far behind are sports, live/taped events from all over, how-to and\\nspecial-interest videos, children\\'s fare, games, adult entertainment and a\\nfew genres spun out of the imagination of others.  \"There may be\\nlocalized-content opportunities,\" chirps In Demand\\'s Jacobsen. \"Local\\ntheater, high school football games with real community value.\" In a COD\\nworld, \"you\\'re not limited to video product,\" says TVN senior business\\ndevelopment VP Jim Riley. \"Eventually, you download computer software so you\\ncan view it on your TV as well as on your PC. That\\'s where we\\'re driving\\nsome of our development energies.\" TVN\\'s vehicle is Chromazone, involving\\nCalifornia-based venture capitalist Digital Evolution. From the start,\\nIntertainer has embraced a link of COD with interactive elements. \"If MSOs\\nmake the investment in VOD, they must maximize it with advertising,\\ne-commerce and all sorts of interactivity,\" says Jonathan Taplan,\\nIntertainer\\'s president and CEO. \"That\\'s the ultimate promise. If you think\\nabout the capital investment and the possible return in gross revenues, like\\n$20 a sub per month, that\\'s a damn good business.\" Diva, infused with $9\\nmillion earlier this summer from operating system/middleware players OpenTV\\nand Liberate Technologies (CV, 7/17/00, p. 98), now has economic backing to\\npursue its own interactive-integration course. And soon, cable operators\\nwill see if their VOD future should incorporate subscription\\nvideo-on-demand, or SVOD. Encore Media Group, under CEO John Sie, is betting\\na substantial chunk of its future on it, and in a matter of weeks, AT&T\\nBroadband\\'s newly acquired Atlanta system (off the completed MediaOne\\nmerger) will test SVOD out using Encore, Starz! and Encore\\'s multiplex\\nmovies. Here\\'s the SVOD deal, as Sie explains it: Premium service subs, for\\nan extra fee, get 20-30 titles running on that service that month on-demand,\\nwith VCR functionality. The subs watch those films whenever they want, as\\nmany times as they want, for that one fee. Six or eight dollars a month will\\ndo. \"We\\'re using VOD as a viewer enhancement platform,\" Sie insists. \"Movies\\nwill drive things first. Once they drive penetration, you can do\\nsubscription news-on-demand and other things on-demand.\" Lately, Sie\\'s SVOD\\nadvocacy comes framed inside a clarion call to move operators in the\\ndirection of all-digital system conversion. Direct broadcast satellite\\nservices are that way now, and Sie believes cable system owners have two\\nyears at most to make that transition, contrary to the seven-to-10-year\\ntimeframe other industry execs predict. \"You know and I know consumer demand\\nfor digital far exceeds set-top box availability, as well as the supply of\\ninstallation crews. DBS realized that and now they\\'re ramping up,\" Sie\\nbelieves. But opponents find two flaws in SVOD: Because the product is\\navailable in the premium window, six months or more after PPV availability,\\nthere may not be as much audience demand for it compared to pre-PPV.\\nIndependent of audience demand, there\\'s the specter of cannibalization,\\nwhere on-demand use comes at the expense of premium-channel viewing. \"Here\\'s\\na way to enhance and optimize premium services,\" Nussrallah concludes. \"If\\nyou get constant access to the programming, it\\'s more customer-friendly, and\\nsomething DBS can\\'t provide. Cable is built on the concept that the audience\\nbuys more if they have more choice and convenience. It may be the next\\nopportunity window.\" Not so, Taplin figures. \"It would be cool to get all of\\nThe Sopranos on a VOD package. But why would people who already see movies\\non premium pay for more of those same movies, after they\\'ve had the chance\\nto watch those movies in an on-demand way. Unless Sie prices it so low, or\\nunless they like those movies a lot, why would they pay again? The flat-fee\\nmodel is a great model, like cellular-phone pricing. People love paying one\\nfee for unlimited monthly use. But the window isn\\'t the right window.\" Sie\\ndefends SVOD as an enhancement option. \"Would an operator launch digital\\ncable with pay TV only and not launch PPV, concluding that PPV cannibalizes\\npay, or vice versa? No, because they complement each other beautifully. Same\\nhere.\" Other VOD programmers and tech vendors will pursue SVOD experiments.\\nTVN is investigating one or more affiliate partnerships for a test. Classic\\nand Susquehanna are open to proposals. \"What John says is super. What does\\nit cost me? I\\'ve got a stock market and bond market to work with,\" Belisle\\nsays.\\nStream Thinking\\nSusquehanna exec Templain calls SVOD \"a work in progress platform.\" Others\\nsay the same about streamed video content, another pot worthy of industry\\nexploitation. \"Spectacular\" may be the most accurate adjective for the\\nassortment of video Internet sites have streamed to PC households\\neverywhere, from quirky animation to short films to news clips. More\\ndiverse, longer streamed content is coming down the pike. Will the very same\\ntech making mass VOD deployment possible now also make possible a new\\noriginal content pipe? What an ironic circumstance. Check in with the sites\\nthemselves, from Real Networks on down, and the masterminds behind them\\npoint to TV and cable display as their final destination. Fifty million PCs,\\nmore than 100 million TV homes, almost 70 percent of them cabled -- the\\nmarket\\'s obvious to them. In the end, that\\'s the ticket, cable execs concur.\\nBut for the near term, no. The broadcast quality\\'s not there yet (although\\ntech strides are happening), and there\\'s considerable fear that producers\\nwill use streaming to bypass cable nets. Gordon targets mid to late 2001 as\\nthe point where streamed content will be TV/VOD-suitable. Assuming the\\nindustry locks its fears away, nCube\\'s Pohl sides with the crowd awaiting\\n\"this kind of ubiquitous media, where things go to the TV or PC.\" \"We\\'re\\nsleeping fine at night about this, because the quality is not there yet,\"\\nadds Diva\\'s Zucker. \"But we will make video streaming a Holy Grail for TV in\\nthe next few years, and cable will be uniquely positioned to take advantage\\nof it.\" *\\n\\n <<...>>\\nHOME </> | CURRENT ISSUE </contents/2000/0814/> | BACK ISSUES </contents/> |\\nDATABASE </database/> | LINKS </links/> | ABOUT US </about_cv/>  All\\ncontents , 2000 Cahners Business Information. <http://www.cahners.com> All\\nrights reserved.

       " '> Dr. Mr. Lay,\\n>\\n> I apologize for the \"cold call\" by e-mail, but this appears to be the\\n> easiest way to contact you, given communications from Mexico, where I am\\n> currently working and living.  We did meet some years ago at a conference\\n> in Houston when I was a VP of Union Gas, Ontario, Canada, which was later\\n> bought by Westcoast Energy and to which I migrated.\\n>\\n> I served as Vice President, International, of Westcoast Energy Inc. for 5\\n> years after Union Gas.  A year ago I elected to form my own consulting\\n> company when Westcoast constricted its international program in Asia, my\\n> prime area of interest at that time, to fund Alliance and their Mexican\\n> projects.  I remain on very good terms with Westcoast and have since done\\n> considerable work in Mexico for them.  Our Asia work was a real success,\\n> and we built the first Canadian power plant in China, and acquired and\\n> expanded a $550 MM US power plant in Indonesia.   Both are business and\\n> technical successes, and both were developed and built under my\\n> leadership.\\n>\\n> My current 8 month consulting assignment here in Mexico City for a large\\n> multi-national joint venture wraps up this month, and I am now seeking\\n> other employment. We would be happy to stay in Latin America/Caribbean, go\\n> back on the Asia beat, or try another geographical location.  My\\n> preference is contract work, full or part time, although I would consider\\n> full time permanent employment.  I thought perhaps Enron might have\\n> opportunities for someone with my experience and talents.\\n>\\nMy interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by\\ntraining, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20\\nyears.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy\\nstrategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from the\\ninternational plan I did as the first ever VP, International at Westcoast\\nEnergy.\\n\\n> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast\\n> Energy\\'s Asia business development and operations, we invested (with\\n> partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including\\n> clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a\\n> record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to\\n> screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.\\n>\\n> The contracts I have been working on in Mexico are Pemex contracts, but\\n> are similar to the contracts used by CFE for IPPs, and drafted by the same\\n> law firm,  if Rosarito is any example.  Having worked on $60 MM claims\\n> under these contracts, I am very familiar with the problems that these\\n> contracts have, the various possible interpretations, and the possible\\n> \"fixes\".   If, as I suspect, Enron are interested in more power\\n> development in the rapidly expanding/opening Mexican IPP market, I believe\\n> I could offer solid advice on the contracts, the players, and the risks.\\n>\\n> The first page of my CV is below in e-mail form.  If it is of interest,\\n> the complete CV is attached.  A list of services my consulting company\\n> provides is available upon request.

They promise at least seven governors and \\na lot of other distinguished people.? It seems to us that this is a very \\ntimely event. \\n\\nThey would like to invite you to be the luncheon speaker.? (I will be \\nkicking off the conference).?? It looks to be a very good and high \\nvisibility platform.? And they would be very keen and excited -- and \\nhonored -- to have you in that featured role in it works for your schedule. \\n\\nIt takes place in Columbus, Ohio, on September 20. \\n\\nTony is a very good guy, and of course natural gas as well as oil looms \\nvery large for him.? You'll enjoy talking with him.? He can certainly fill \\nyou in further on what they would like to accomplish. \\n\\nIf it works out for you to do this in terms of your schedule and interest, \\nthat would be great. \\n\\nOn behalf of the governors, thank you for the consideration. \\n\\nBest, \\n\\nDan \\n\\n\\n\",\n",

You and your team are breaking new ground in\\nyour business with impressive speed.  We hope to match that type of\\nperformance within e.Lilly.\\n\\nI had several key takeaways that were notewothy:\\n\\n1. Build your e.commerce strategy from the customer\\'s perspective.  Louise,\\nyou demonstrated this by the intense focus on the traders\\' requirements for\\nEnronOnline.\\n2. As Peter Drucker points out in his 1994 article on the \"Theory of\\nBusiness\", you must have clear assumptions about your environment, mission\\nand core competencies.  The establishment of Enron Networks seems to be\\nbuilt upon your strong ability to assess a potential market for\\ncommoditization and then leverage your strong trading capabilities and\\ncontrol processes in order to create or redefine the market(eg. pulp/paper,\\nsteel,bandwidth).\\n3. You provide people a chance to understand the business and be\\naccountable early in their career.  The example of one of your top traders\\nillustrated the performance-based culture that you are developing while\\nother examples showed the business breadth that is provided to key talent.\\n4. In the new economy (probably in the old one, too), there is no defense,\\nonly offense.  Again, that mantra seems to grow out of a strong bias for\\naction within Enron Networks as you recognize that you must re-create\\nyourself (Online gas market) and move aggressively into new ones.\\n5. Louise, your EnronOnline initiative epitomized the phrase:  \"Ask for\\nforgiveness, not for permission.\"  In other words, get it done; get it done\\nright, and the little things - like the budget - will take care of\\nthemselves.\\n\\nLet me know if we can ever return the favor.  Greg, we may want to discuss\\na few risk management questions with you sometime in the future as we are\\nbuilding some innovative discovery research ventures that would benefit\\nfrom your insight in this area.\\n\\nThanks again for your time.

Since that time, I have had some \\nhealth problems that are leading me to retire a little early from Enron, on \\nAugust 31, 2000. \\n\\n I did not want to leave Enron\\'s active employment until I had the \\nopportunity to express to you my gratitude.  I have been with Northern \\nNatural Gas, InterNorth, HNG-InterNorth and Enron for thirty two years and 1 \\nmonth.  I can tell you without hesitation, that since you took over our \\ncompany in the late 80\\'s, it has been the most challenging and exciting time \\nthat I have spent in my work life.  I had opportunities that I never dreamt \\nof and I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had.   I started on \\nAugust 1, 1968 as a maintenance helper at the South Omaha location of \\nNorthern Natural Gas.  I was a field technician, an O&M Supervisor, a \\nDistrict Manager, and presently the Manager of the Operations Communications \\nCenter in Omaha.\\n\\nI have admired and respected you since the first time we met in Des Moines, \\nIowa, shortly after the merger.  Without your guidance and direction and the \\nmany employee based programs you have initiated, I would not be where I am \\nfinancially today.  I am looking forward to retirement without concern for me \\nor my family\\'s future.  The ESOP program was so very important to all of the \\nemployees, and the many other programs like our \"options\", variable pay \\n(bonus) and others make Enron a leader throughout the world in employee \\nsatisfaction, and we have the awards to prove it.\\n\\nThe employees that I have worked with in these 32 years are the bright spots \\nfor Enron, not only in the past but also into the future.  We have done a \\nwonderful job of getting the best of the best.\\n\\nI hope that I will be able to thank you in person and shake your hand once \\nmore, perhaps at a future shareholders meeting.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nRod Williams\\n\\n\\n',\n",

We have very strong\\ninsight into their intent and knew they would  use this aggressively in\\ntheir PR campaigns.\\n\\nHowever, clearly it was our job to win the business on the merits of the\\nindividual program and to compete hard for it.

As a member of our Board,\\nand as a leader in the Houston community this will be news and I am hopeful\\nwe can find a creative way to balance it.\\n\\nAgain, I accept it was ours to win in the marketplace but regret it had to\\ncome to this.

It is also important\\nto note that we have been actively partnering with EBS on non-contractual\\nareas, such as our ongoing technical joint development and marketing efforts\\naround the Windows Streaming Media product.  I understand that our teams\\nhave been working very closely together -- and with Microsoft -- to resolve\\ntechnical issues with Windows Streaming Media and thereby speed EBS' market\\ndeployment.\\n\\nThe major issue is that Enron does not support traffic to many of our\\nconcentration point so we need to be creative.\\n\\nBottom line, we are down to solvable problems with solution activities\\nunderway.\\n\\n* Windows 2000\\n\\n\\nDuring the last week of May Compaq responded to a request from Enron to\\nsupport Windows 2000 deployments, and placed people on site with no defined\\ncontract or process due to Enron's requirements.  At this writing, no\\ncontract has been signed, and the current contract iteration is at number\\nfourteen.  Apparently the delivery scope has changed several times and there\\nhave been a few mistrals. Compaq is continuing to provide resources despite\\nthe fact that no contract is in place and will work with Enron to ensure a\\nsuccessful completion of the project.\\n\\n* Power Management\\n\\nJesse Greene, our CFO, will act as the contact point for Enron for power\\nmanagement services. The issue is we have existing contracts at favorable\\nrates but we will break the log jam.\\n\\n* HomePC Program\\n\\nFor several months, Compaq and Enron have been working the solution to bring\\ntechnology and Internet access into the homes of every Enron employee.\\nThere have been many creative discussions around hardware and financing to\\nallow Enron to fully subsidize the package provided.  Compaq, Enron and\\nCompaq Financial Services had gotten to a point where the $35 per month cap\\nwas going to require the specifications of the hardware to be reduced.  In\\nrecognition of the value of our partnership and our mutual desire for this\\nprogram to be the premier program in the industry, we have increased the\\nspecifications of the hardware while taking significant pricing actions and\\nfinancing rate reductions.  These actions will actually allow Enron to\\nsupport better than expected hardware with the extended warranty for $34.28\\nper month.   This will truly be an industry-leading program when launched\\nlater this fall.\",\n",

Trophies include two\\nat the AXIEM (Absolute Excellence in Electronic Media) Awards in the U.S.,\\nand the Telly Awards for non-network broadcasts, comparable to a U.S. TV\\nshow winning an Emmy.\\n<http://newscpq1.inline.cpqcorp.net/article.cfm?storyid=968>\\n\\nService Provider/.com wins\\nData Return, a leading global provider of advanced managed hosting services,\\nwas recognized by Microsoft as \"Global Hosting Partner of the Year\" during\\nthe Fusion 2000 Awards Banquet. The award noted Data Return\\'s ongoing work\\nwith the Windows 2000 team in developing managed hosting solutions for\\ncustomers whose applications are based on the Microsoft platform. This\\nrepresents a tremendous win for Compaq as well, since Data Return is using\\nCompaq hardware and services exclusively for its hosting services.\\n\\nOn July 31st, Compaq, Microsoft, Digex and IDC launched a series of Webcasts\\nto help educate Compaq Field Sales and the Compaq/Microsoft Channel. The\\nseries, presented by a top IDC analyst, emphasized the tremendous market\\nopportunity within the ASP market. Based on the overwhelming participation\\nand positive feedback, there is a strong interest in learning more about the\\nASP market. The second in the series will be presented September 7. To\\nregister, call 800-289-0579 (outside US 719-457-2550).\\n\\nCoconut.com, an ASP in the UK initially offering mail and messaging, has\\nnamed Compaq its key partner.  The solution, heavily leveraged around our\\nProfessional Services capability, is Alpha and StorageWorks running\\nSoftware.com\\'s suite of carrier-grade mail and messaging products.  The\\ninfrastructure will be managed by eBMS.  HP had been working on this for 18\\nmonths, and Compaq got engaged the day before they were about to sign the\\ndeal.  Seven weeks later HP was told they had lost the opportunity.  The key\\nto our success was a partnering approach to help them with their business,\\nnot just to sell them tin.  The near-term opportunity is $5M, with up to\\n$25M over 5 years.  Congratulations to the UK team!\\n\\nGreat Compaq Financial Services deals\\nSupply Access - CFS is providing a $6.5M financing facility on Alpha and NT\\nservers for this service provider, owned by En Point, one of Compaq\\'s\\nlargest resellers in California.  The deal, which displaced HP and HP\\nFinance, includes a two-year exclusivity agreement.\\n\\nAvantel - CFS also completed a $3.5M deal to refresh the installed base of\\nAvantel\\'s existing Compaq desktops and servers in Mexico.  While Avantel is\\na longtime Compaq customer, the inclusion of Compaq Financial Services\\nenabled a complex sale and lease back arrangement for the acquisition of\\nCompaq equipment, with opportunities for ongoing contact with the customer.\\n\\nRoundup of Storage news\\nAs you may have noticed from the earnings news, the Storage Product Group\\nhad a strong Q2, with profitability of $179M, up 45% from last year.  SPG\\ndelivered 11.8% of Compaq\\'s net sales, 17.8% of total gross margin, and a\\nwhopping 31.6 % of Compaq\\'s operating income. Other news from the Storage\\nfront includes:\\n * A SANworks print ad campaign, directed at corporate CIOs,\\nstarted on July 10th and will be running for several weeks. The ads direct\\ncustomers to a Web companion page for more information, go to\\n<http://www.compaq.com/sanworks>.\\n * On August 22, Compaq will open a new Enterprise Storage\\nCustomer Center (ESCC) in Colorado Springs, Colo., that will develop and\\nqualify advanced network storage technologies for complex enterprise\\nenvironments and offer training for IT professionals. The Center will\\ncomplement the new Storage Networking Technology Center that was announced\\nearlier this spring by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA)\\nand is currently being constructed by Compaq.  Both centers will be housed\\nunder one roof when the SNIA center opens later this year.\\n * The Storage Networks Solutions Business Unit, focused on\\nproviding leading-edge solutions to the industry, has created a Business\\nDevelopment Team. For more information, contact Frank Orlando, who leads the\\nteam.\\n\\nZero Latency and other BCSG attention-getters\\nWhat debuted 10 months ago at Telecom99 as a riveting demonstration of\\nCompaq\\'s first Zero Latency Enterprise (ZLE) technology has matured into a\\nformal go-to-market program that will be launched and rolled out in October.\\nIts goal?  To help you identify ZLE opportunities and win deals.  The\\nBusiness Critical Server Group (BCSG) has established the ZLE Initiative to\\nencompass all of our enterprise offerings - Himalaya; AlphaServer with Tru64\\nUnix and OpenVMS; and ProLiant with Windows NT, as well as storage, clients\\nand services.  It will differentiate Compaq in the marketplace, generate\\nmomentum for the company, and give us \"first-to-market\" status.  No other\\ncompetitor can come close to what we offer.  The typical ZLE deal profile is\\nhigh-revenue - $15M per deal - and high-margin, so the payoff is great.\\nStay tuned for announcements in October, including info on ZLE customers;\\ncool new offerings incorporating platforms, partners and services; new\\ndemos; go-to-market tools to help you tell the ZLE story; ZLE expertise to\\nassist with your accounts; and press and analyst proof points to help you\\nsell.  I encourage you to learn more about ZLE so you can leverage its\\nrevenue potential.  For more information, contact your BCSG region drivers.\\n\\nOther highlights from BCSG:\\n * Congratulations to the Tandem BU for its Q2 performance, the\\nsecond highest in revenue for the BU in Compaq history.  In addition, the\\nS74 series had the fastest ramp in the history of the Himalaya platform,\\nwith $69M in S74000 processors shipped since its May launch.\\n * MUZO, a Czech payment authorization agency and long-time\\ncustomer, will migrate to the most powerful of the Himalaya servers, the\\nS74000, for its new authorization center opening in 1Q01.  MUZO provides\\nATM/POS authorization and back-office services using Base24 from partner\\nACI.  The order is important for Compaq in the Czech Republic because it\\npositions the platform firmly in the country and demonstrates the success of\\nthe ongoing efforts of the Czech subsidiary to build local Himalaya\\nresources and skills.\\n * The \"Dream Machine\" roadshow, which showcases the\\nAlphaServer GS160 server running OpenVMS Galaxy, is starting its North\\nAmerican tour. One of its first stops was in Boston in late July, where it\\nreceived an enthusiastic response from the Compaq Board of Directors.\\n * Recently named a partner for Oracle\\'s iHost applications\\nhosting initiative, Nupremis is the first service provider to announce that\\nit will host Oracle iHost applications on AlphaServers running Tru64 UNIX in\\nits data centers to provide the most scalable and highly available platform\\nfor e-business.\\n\\nGreat things happening in the Consumer world\\n* In 1Q, Compaq surpassed Packard Bell as the US installed base market\\nshare leader for the first time, according to Media Metrix.  The number of\\nCompaq PCs in US homes has increased 260% to 5.4 million from 1997 through\\n1Q.\\n* Presario portable PCs maintained their No. 1 U.S. retail sales share\\nin June for the 22nd consecutive month, according to NPD Intelect\\n* The Presario 1200XL-110 was rated a Best Buy and No. 1 Budget\\nnotebook by PC World magazine\\n* The Presario 1800T was rated the No. 5 Power notebook by PC World\\nmagazine\\n* Compaq\\'s 2Q consumer PC sales in Malaysia were up over 1,200%, due\\nlargely to Compaq\\'s kiosk strategy there.  The kiosks have been successful\\nenough to be featured in the Far East Economic Review\\n* Compaq beat out four other PC manufacturers to partner with\\nspecialty retailer Eddie Bauer on special edition Presario 1400 series\\nportable PCs\\n\\nJoint news from Consumer and CPCG\\nBy now I\\'m sure you\\'ve read about the exciting new additions to the iPAQ\\nfamily of products and services, announced jointly by Mike Larson and Mike\\nWinkler in New York on August 15.  The announcement symbolizes the growing\\nconvergence of the commercial and consumer markets, and the mutual desire\\nfor information and Internet access by our customers.\\n\\nIn addition, CPCG deserves special congratulations on their outstanding 2Q\\nresults - returning to profitability one quarter ahead of what was expected!\\nAll regions were profitable, contributing to the total $63M in operating\\nprofit.  The group achieved the best portable shipment quarter on record,\\nshipped the 100,000th iPAQ desktop, and the iPAQ Pocket PC demand is 10\\ntimes the initial forecast!  And by the looks of all the commercial products\\nwins listed in this report, the momentum is continuing.  For an interesting\\nQ&A by CNET News.com with Mike Winkler on the group\\'s achievement, see:\\n<http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-201-2375731-0.html>\\n\\nNew ISSG product announcements and recognition\\nISSG has been busy with a lot of new product announcements, including the\\nindustry\\'s first high-performance network attached server appliance, the\\nTaskSmart N-Series, new clustering solutions for SCO, Oracle and Microsoft.\\nMore news includes:\\n * The ProLiant 8500 is now Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 Best Performance\\non the TPC-C top 10 list.  The Compaq Benchmarks result in a Price/tpmC that\\nis approximately $10 lower than the top marking IBM number and is using SQL\\nServer 2000 instead of DB2.  We even pushed the Sun 10000 off the top 10\\nlist.\\nCheck out the great review and double awards for the ProLiant DL360 by\\nInternetWeek Magazine, titled, \"Rack \\'Em Up.\"\\n<http://www.internetwk.com/reviews00/rev071700.htm>\\n\\nCompaq dominates Commerce One\\'s Global Trading Web portals\\nNot only do we power C1\\'s own MarketSite.net U.S. portal and all its hosted\\ninstallations, but we also power an overwhelming number of its major portal\\npartners.

       " 'Thanks so much for your most generous gift to complete the funding for the\\nprofessorship honoring Pinkney Walker.  I\\'m delighted that you plan to\\nattend the Davenport Society banquet on October 13.\\n\\nThe purpose of this e-mail, which Rosalee suggested as the most efficient\\nway of reaching you, is two-fold:\\n\\n     1. To seek your endorsement of naming the new professorship the Pinkney\\nC. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship.  Rather than designating the\\nprofessorship for Business and Economics, for Business Theory, or for some\\nother area, I\\'d like to use it to recognize and reward a faculty member in\\nthe College of Business who is especially known for teaching effectiveness.\\nBoth Bob Pugh and Ralph Clark endorse this approach; I have a call into\\nHarold Hook to seek his input.\\n\\nA few points of elaboration:\\n     * \"Distinguished\" is a standard adjective in the titles of such\\npositions.\\n     * We will use a committee of faculty and administrators within the\\ncollege to select the recipient of the professorship, subject to my\\napproval.\\n     * And, I don\\'t know if we will have the recipient selected by October\\n13.\\n\\nThis name for the professorship (1) coincides with Pinkney\\'s great strength,\\n(2) allows me to avoid any \"turf battles\" (either within the college or with\\nEconomics) and (3) underscores the great importance of teaching in the\\ncollege.  Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\\n\\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\\n\\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\\n\\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I\\'ve heard is that\\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you\\'ll\\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\\nwill host that evening for members of the college\\'s advisory board.  Of\\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it\\'s\\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\\n\\nKen, thanks very much.  I hope and trust that you had an ample dose of \"R&R\"\\nduring your vacation.  I look forward to hearing from you.',\n",

       " 'The Supreme Court hearing for the case in India regarding the alleged \\nimproper bidding and award of the Panna/Mukta block concluded today.  Our \\nlegal team\\'s opinion is very optimistic based on the way the proceeding \\nprogressed and also on the actions of the chief judge during the concluding \\narguments of the case today in India. \\n\\nThe panel of three judges will now take approximately 2 months to write their \\nopinion and that should complete this case.  While I probably shouldn\\'t  \\nspeculate on the outcome, I will summarize my opinion of the important \\npoints:  1) there is little doubt that the Panna/Mukta award to \\nEnron/Reliance/ONGC will stand, and  2) it is highly unlikely that the judges \\nwill request the PSC to be renegotiated, the contract was portrayed and \\ngenerally accepted by the panel as a very fair deal for the GOI.  According \\nto my general counsel, Stephen Wallace, the only concern our team has is that \\nthe judges were quite critical of the CBI (the government group that \\ninvestigated Reliance for wrong doing in the bid process) during that portion \\nof the testimony and there is a possibility that they could request an \\nadditional investigation.  Our team puts the likelihood of the judges \\nordering a new investigation at less than 50%.  There is downside to such a \\ndecision in that it creates uncertainty, but the focus would be on Reliance, \\nnot Enron. \\n\\nEnron was very prepared on the commercial and the legal front and our team, \\nas expected, carried the load for this case even though we were not the \\nprimary defendants.  Enron presented the major rebuttal to the CPIL \\nassertions because the others were not prepared and then later \"coached\" the \\nothers to help them prepare appropriately.   This was a much more intensive \\ncase than people were assuming it would be last year and we were very \\nfortunate to be extremely well prepared and well represented.   \\n\\nBased on the above information,  I do not think this issue \"CPIL lawsuit\"  \\nshould  impact any future decisions we make regarding the Panna/ Mukta/Tapti \\nassets.  This outcome basically eliminates one of the two issues impeding the \\nprogress of  the  project I showed Joe, our proposal to sell \\nPanna/Mukta/Tapti, that we call Project Janus.  We believe we have a unique \\nopportunity to realize exceptional value for these assets through an \\narrangement with our partner.  The strategy we have mapped out should  allow \\nus to close the transaction prior to year-end and it has very positive cash \\nflow and neutral financial implications (minimal if any gain due to the \\nstep-up last year) for the company.

There is no action requested from you but I wanted you to be \\naware of this development.\\n\\n Last spring we encouraged Azurix to look to OPIC and IDB for funding support \\nfor the financing needed for their Argentinian concession for the province of \\nBuenos Aires.  For the past several months teams from Azurix and the two \\nlending agencies have been moving forward with the expectation that we could \\ngo to an OPIC Board vote in September for $100 million and to the IDB Board \\nin October for $150 million.\\n\\n Everything was going along great until last friday.  Early last week OPIC \\nhad its credit committee review and approve the project, though apparently \\nsome members were concerned about the regulatory risk associated with water \\nprojects. (This would be OPIC\\'s first financing of a water project.)   Friday \\nAM, George Munoz recieved a draft cable from the US Embassy in Argentina \\nproviding their assessment of the project and, on the spot, pulled the \\nproject from Investment Committee and off the calendar for consideration by \\nthe OPIC Board in September.  Friday afternoon, OPIC staff informed Azurix \\nand our office in a meeting that Azurix should be resorting to \"Plan B\", \\nimplying that the project would not go forward in the foreseeable future.  \\nOPIC would not provide Azurix or us with the cable. \\n\\n Over the weekend, the cable was formally sent to Washington, though now \\nreclassified as a classified document so we have not been able to see its \\ncontents.  Moreover, the Ambassador has specifically conveyed his directive \\nto Washington that the cable is not to be shown to anyone outside of the \\ngovernment,   John Garrison has a relationship with the Ambassador but has \\nnot been able to get the Embassy to alter its position, nor would I think \\nthey be inclined to do so now given the fact that they could have \\ndisassociated themselves from the draft on friday but did not.\\n\\n On the positive side, the InterAmerican Development Bank has stated that \\nthey are prepared to consider increasing the size of the B loan to cover the \\nadditional $100 million.   We have met with the IDB and discussed the \\nsituation at OPIC; they seem satisfied at this point.\\n\\n It appears to me that George Munoz is unwilling to take to the Board the \\nAzurix project when a damning cable has been circulated around the government \\neven if the substance of the cable is exaggerated, taken out of context and \\ndistorted.  From what we have learned, the cable containes concerns expressed \\nabout the regulatroy framework, labor issues etc., etc., but also comments \\nfrom the Argentinian goverment about Azurix and the concession about Bahia \\nBlanca and the politics of Azurix in Argentina. It is uncompromisingly \\nnegative in its tone.\\n\\n Azurix is seeking a return of  the $250,000 fee and will withdraw its \\napplication.\\n\\n Hope all is well.  John\\n\\n\\n\\n       \\n',\n",

He is now chairman of the AIP\\nCertification and Accreditation Council.\\n\\nThe energy industry, though cautious about utilizing the web, is scrambling\\nto take advantage of this next big thing.  Recently, several top companies\\nhave taken the plunge to hire Internet professionals to develop their own\\nvirtual training programs.\\n\\nEquiva Services LLC, a joint venture company formed by Texaco Inc., Shell\\nOil Company and Saudi Refining, Inc, ABB Vetco Gray, and Columbia Gulf\\nTransmission Company, have all recently jumped on the e-learning bandwagon.\\nAll three companies have created web-based platforms or e-commerce hubs tha=\\nt\\nenable employees to quickly and conveniently get necessary training from\\npre-selected suppliers.\\n\\n=01&This type of innovative application of information technology will help=\\n us\\nto work smarter and faster for our internal clients,=018 said Mari Duarte,\\nsenior human resources generalist for ABB Vetco Gray.  =01&We expect to low=\\ner\\ncosts and improve efficiency by reducing the time of administrative\\ntransactions related to registration and by improving reporting of\\ninformation related to training activities to management.=018\\n\\nFor the energy industry, E-learning can involve both the automation of\\ntraining management systems as well as the transmission and delivery of\\nlearning to individuals through use of the Internet.  Through this\\ntechnology, training information previously available through classroom\\ninstruction can be delivered directly to employees=01, desktops in differen=\\nt\\nforms, ranging from basic presentation-style courses to highly interactive\\ncourses with digitized video transmissions and on-line discussions.\\n\\n=01&E-learning can encompass training employees and it can be used to share\\nimportant knowledge across the organization and with outside business\\npartners,=018 said Dennis McMullin, energy industry consultant at Proxicom,=\\n a\\nleading Internet consulting firm in Houston, Texas.  McMullin says that mor=\\ne\\ncompanies are increasing the amount of training they offer online to help\\nemployees stay current on market trends and personal skills.  =01&There can=\\n be\\na significant cost savings involved in using technology for learning, but a\\ncompany=01,s success ultimately depends on how effectively it can bring the\\ntechnology into the organization and how well they use it.=018\\n\\nE-learning technology can also ease the administrative burden on an\\norganization=01,s human resources department and lower the per-unit cost of\\ntraining employees.  Additionally, management has the ability to better\\nanalyze training needs and how to best deploy the information.  =01&Web-bas=\\ned\\ntraining is extremely flexible and offers employees convenience in\\nscheduling courses when they need and want them,=018 said McMullin.  =01&It=\\n also\\nallows them the opportunity to go back and revisit course material if the\\nneed a refresher or a resource.  It is a self-teaching method that lets\\nindividuals learn at their own pace and based on their own needs.\"\\n\\nInternet companies such as VerticalNet, Inc. in Horsham, PA, offer companie=\\ns\\nthe ability to manage training programs through an Internet interface that\\ndirectly links the company with training suppliers.  Taken one stop further=\\n,\\nVerticalNet=01,s =01&Training Intelligence Portals=018 enable companies to =\\ncentralize\\ntheir personnel training programs and literally outsource administration an=\\nd\\nother back-office transactions such as invoice management, utilization\\nreporting, course evaluation and quality assurance.\\n\\nAccording to Walter Rogers, VerticalNet=01,s eBusiness training services se=\\nnior\\ndirector and general manager, the energy industry is becoming more\\naggressive in moving from office administration and classroom learning to\\nweb-based technology for training.  =01&We=01,re seeing a lot more demand f=\\nrom the\\nenergy sector for e-learning technology,=018 said Rogers, whose firm is\\ncurrently working with several large energy companies.  =01&We=01,ve found =\\nthat\\nthe energy industry doesn=01,t typically lead the way in the use of technol=\\nogy.\\nIt tends to want to see it working and proven in other areas before they tr=\\ny\\nit.  But now they are getting more involved.  Since the industry is driven\\nto reduce operating costs, it finds this technology to be very cost\\neffective.=018\\n\\nIn addition to hiring Internet experts to develop and manage a training\\nsite, Dennis McMullin points out that there is a large variety of existing\\ntraining opportunities for on-line learning.  =01&Most of the technology\\ncompanies offer on-line training for technical products, while numerous web\\nsites offer free information and opportunities for e-learning,=018 he said.\\n\\nIn the end, however, McMullin believes that acceptance of the Internet is\\nmore than a technological issue for many companies, rather it requires a\\ncultural adjustment.  =01&It really is an issue of adjusting the company\\nculture to accept and benefit from Internet technology.  It requires\\ncompanies to be more open and less fearful of sharing information.  Energy\\ncompanies could really benefit from effective use of the Internet if they\\nuse it as a median to share more knowledge throughout their organizations\\nand with suppliers.=018\\n\\n\\n\\nNEWS ROUND-UP\\n\\n\\nDUKE SOLUTIONS USING B2B MARKETPLACE TO REDUCE CLIENT BILLS\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml>#news1\\n\\nTS HUB: A NEW OFFERING FROM FT ENERGY\\n <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news2>\\n\\nGE POWER SYSTEMS ANNOUNCES OFFER TO ACQUIRE SMALLWORLD PLC\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news3>\\n\\nOPENLINK EXPANDS EUROPEAN OPERATIONS\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news4>\\n\\nPARKER DRILLING CONSIDERS INTERNET OPPORTUNITIES\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news5>\\n\\nPOWERTRUST.COM APPOINTS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#news6>\\n\\n******************************************************\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nE-BUSINESS FOR ENERGY ASIA PACIFIC\\nOctober 7-9, 2000  Singapore\\nLearn how the e-business explosion is changing the Asian Pacific energy\\nsector\\nhttp://www.eyeforenergy.com/asia-pacific\\n\\nINTRANET AND PORTAL STRATEGIES FOR ENERGY\\nOctober 17-19, 2000  Houston, TX\\nThe premier annual US forum on internal e-business strategies for the entir=\\ne\\nenergy industry\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/ipse>\\n\\n*******************************************************\\n\\nCASE STUDY\\n\\nSpare plant parts become manageable with Sparesfinder.com\\n\\nOne of the Internet=01,s most powerful features is its ability to make\\ninformation instantly available that once was virtually impossible to get.\\nThat=01,s exactly the power behind sparesFinder.com, an Internet service th=\\nat\\nallows chemical, petroleum and power companies to manage their own\\ninventories of factory parts and search the inventories of other companies\\naround the globe for needed replacements.\\n\\nClick here for full article:\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case1>\\n\\n\\nCASE STUDY\\n\\nDeregulation and the Consumer\\n\\nConventional wisdom tells us to =01&build it and they will come.=018 With o=\\nver\\n$300 billion at stake in the U.S. energy market alone, it is not surprising\\nthat the young-guns of the Internet world are homing in on the traditional\\nlegacy laden utilities as deregulation tears away at their regional\\nmonopolies.\\n\\nClick here for full article:\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#case2>\\n\\n\\nRELATED INDUSTRY FEATURES\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related>\\n\\nREDMETEOR.COM CHOOSE SAGAVISTA FOR BACKEND INTEGRATION SOLUTION\\n <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related1>\\nTRADIANT TEAMS WITH ANDERSEN CONSULTING TO BRING THE POWER OF THE WEB TO\\nGLOBAL SHIPPING INDUSTRY\\n<http://www.eyeforenergy.com/energy/newsletter060900.shtml#related2>\\n\\n*******************************************************\\n\\nTo subscribe for the e-commerce for energy briefing\\nEmail   : energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com\\n<mailto:energynews-subscribe-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>\\n\\nTo unsubscribe,\\nEmail  energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com\\n<mailto:energynews-signoff-request@peach.ease.lsoft.com>\\n\\nTo comment on this newsletter or add your own content please\\nEmail Michelle at ecenergy@firstconf.com\\n\\n******************************************************\\n\\ne-business for energy briefing\\nWednesday September 6 2000\\nIssue 10\\n\\n*******************************************************\\nDisclaimer - First Conferences and its agents used their best efforts in\\ncollecting and preparing the information published herein.

To date, it has focused on developing a platform\\n\\ntechnology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek\\n\\nwalls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered\\n\\nonly by injection.

Included in the cut list are flights to San Francisco, Las\\nVegas, Los Angeles, and New York.  Following is the statement I am releasing\\nto the media today about my disappointment about the situation this leaves\\nus in and my plans to look for alternate carriers.\\n\\nTo be removed from the \"E-Katz\" distribution list, simply reply to this\\ne-mail with your request.  If you have multiple e-mail addresses you use,\\nplease include a name and/or company, otherwise we may not be able to locate\\nthe correct entry to remove.  For more information on the Katz\\nadministration, visit our website at http://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"I am very disappointed by today\\'s announcement.  This is a big loss for\\nPortland, and it will have a lasting effect on our economy.\\n\\n\"Perhaps because of the current strong economy, Portlanders have\\nconsistently rated efforts to \\'grow as an international city\\' lowest on\\ntheir list of priorities.  Still, as Mayor I worked long and hard with Delta\\nover the last ten years and fought for their routes to Osaka and Fukuoka,\\nbecause I felt strongly that Portland\\'s future was in being an international\\ncity.  Portland will not continue to thrive if we accept doing business only\\nwithin the confines of our city limits.  With the high tech economy of today\\nand the reach of the internet, we must reach across borders.\\n\\n\"That\\'s why I\\'ve led efforts to create business strategies --\\nInternationalizing Greater Portland I & II -- which focused on air and trade\\nconnections because our business partners are no longer just on the other\\nside of town, or even the other side of the state.  We are competing in\\nmarkets around the world, and with Delta\\'s decision we are losing an\\nimportant link to our partners and friends in Asia.

       " \"Ken/Joe,  As I was walking back to my office reflecting on our conversation, \\nthere are three points that I mentioned but I think got lost in the \\ndiscussion.\\n\\n1)  This needs to be a stock deal to avoid Indian tax (48%), poorly written \\npreferential purchase language and gov't approval.  (Still requires RBI \\napproval)  All of the numbers I have in the document assume a stock \\ntransaction. \\n\\n2) RIL is very tax advantaged, currently and for the foreseeable future they \\nwill be in an NOL position;  therefore, at the numbers we are discussing they \\nshould see this as an unleveraged return opportunity of 16% (stock purchase \\nfully taxed with no basis) to 27% (stock purchase shielded from taxes-- Btax \\nscenario).   Again, the tax position makes RIL unique for this transaction \\nand a very likely buyer at these numbers.  Few other parties will be as \\npositioned to consider a stock transaction of a company with minimal Indian \\nbasis, accept the operational conditions and be able to close as quickly.  \\n\\n 3) The idea of coupling the other India assets with the E&P is a good \\nstrategy if your goal is to ultimately sale, but time is unimportant.   I've \\ndone multi-asset deals before with a major and the bureaucracy rivals India.  \\nThe due diligence on the multiple assets will eliminate any chance of closing \\nthis year. In fact, I would be surprised if we could even get a PSA signed \\nbefore year-end on a multi-asset deal, plus the gov't approvals become more \\ncomplex.  \\n\\n If the goal is money in the door before 12/31/00,  I favor a buy/sell at \\nKen's number.  If we go to October and don't get the documents in place we \\nreally haven't lost anything because there is little likelihood of closing \\nunder a traditional scenario even if we start today.   We will prepare our \\ndataroom while the negotiations on the documents take place and be ready to \\nbring in bidders by October. If we buy at these numbers I believe we can flip \\nthe deal within 6-9 months if not sooner since we have operatorship, critical \\nmass a major would covet, only one partner and Reliance is not a partner.  \\n\\nAlso,  If we elect to go to a traditional auction, I would strongly suggest \\nwe keep the E&P separate from the other India assets, at least initially, to \\nrun the auction with the best chance of getting a PSA signed before \\nyear-end.   We can always combine them at a later date during negotiations \\nonce we see how the process is going.  Too many pieces right out of the box \\nwill be very cumbersome and time consuming.  If we have to combine them to \\nget interest, we can do it as we see the need for an enhancement.\\n \\n\\nMy final thought, if we do an outright sale to RIL ( not a pre-negotiated \\nbuy/sell with stipulated closing dates,,, etc.) they will want to do a \\ncertain amount of due diligence and rightfully so.   They would expect and \\nprobably demand the same considerations as any other buyer including a \\ndataroom visit to pick our brains one more time.  Again this becomes a time \\nissue!!  Under the buy/sell scenario we have devised, there is no due \\ndiligence period, the structure of the deal is stipulated and everything is \\nhandled via representations and warranties in the pre-negotiated PSA.     \\n\\n\\nLet me know how and when you wish to proceed.   I will pursue with complete \\ndedication whichever option you select.\\n\\nThanks for the time to share my thoughts,\\njeff\",\n",

Please let me know whether you are agreeable to this name.\\n\\n     2. To ask you to serve as the keynote speaker for the Davenport Society\\nbanquet on October 13.  We would be honored if you would present a brief\\ntalk (perhaps 10 minutes in length) related to some aspect of the future of\\nbusiness.  Your doing so would certainly add luster to an always festive\\nevent.  By way of brief background, Jack and Mary Bush, MU alumni who now\\nlive in Dallas and are co-chairs of the Davenport Society this year, have\\nchosen the future of business as the theme for the banquet and program.\\nYour talk would come after dinner and could be preceded or followed\\n(probably followed) by the announcement of the Pinkney Walker Professorship.\\nI understand from Rosalee that you will be giving a talk in Austin the\\nmorning of October 13; perhaps an abridged version of it would be suitable\\nfor the Davenport Society banquet.  Of course, you have great latitude in\\nchoosing the topic you would like to address.  Please let me know if you\\nwill serve as the keynote speaker.\\n\\nIf you can give me quick responses to these 2 requests, we will complete the\\nplans for the evening, which will include the annoucement of the Pinkney\\nWalker Professorship and, I hope, a keynote address by you.  Naturally, if\\nyou have questions, either you or Rosalee can call me.  My office # is\\n573/882-6688, and my home # is 573/875-2972.\\n\\nLet me close by mentioning that there was some question as to whether or not\\nPinkney would attend the banquet on October 13.  Apparently he had/has been\\nexperiencing some health problems.  However, the latest I\\'ve heard is that\\nhe intends to attend, due in large part to your commitment to be there.\\nTime permitting, you might want to give him a quick call to tell him you\\'ll\\nsee him here in Columbia on October 13.  (By the way, if Pinkney and his\\nwife arrive on October 12, I will invite them to attend an informal dinner I\\nwill host that evening for members of the college\\'s advisory board.  Of\\ncourse, you are invited to attend the dinner on October 12 as well, but it\\'s\\nmy understanding that you will fly to Columbia on October 13.)\\n\\nKen, thanks very much.

       " \"Ken,  I thought it would be better if I typed my thoughts for you since my \\nhand writing can be somewhat difficult to read. \\n\\nBefore you decide the methodology for moving our project beyond the D. Ambani \\nphone call, I would like to share a few thoughts that I believe reduces the \\nrisk of Enron being an E&P buyer.  I know the implications of making a large \\nE&P purchase are far greater than just the cash requirement, but I believe \\nwith the following changes to the plan presented yesterday and a little 3rd \\nparty information, you may feel more comfortable making this decision.  Under \\nthe buy/sell arrangement a small risk of buying will always be present, but I \\nbelieve the risk reward ratio in this case has very strong merit.  My goals \\nfor Enron are three fold; a) sale the assets, b) get cash in the door before \\nyear-end, and c) get fair value for the assets given the current situation.  \\nMy comments touch upon five topics:\\n\\n1)  Reverse the buy/sell process giving Enron the control vote\\n2)  Pay the Penalty\\n3) Contact someone at the Janus Fund to talk about Reliance's Financial \\ncondition\\n4) Thoughts on non-Reliance bidder's\\n5) Information and the future process\\n\\nReverse the Buy/Sell Process:   The plan outlined yesterday using the \\nbuy/sell scenario is the best scenario for achieving all of our goals.  The \\nrisk for Enron which is most troubling is the possibility of being a buyer \\nversus a desire to be a seller.  I firmly believe if we make one change to \\nthe plan as described below, we can increase our probability of a successful \\nsale to near 100%.  If we don't use a but/sell arrangement I am concerned \\nthat we will not get fair value or cash in the door this year.   In fact, I \\nsuspect we will elect not to sell because of contract or valuation problems, \\nwhich in effect leave us with a stranded asset and a lot of employee \\nproblems.   \\n\\nWhen you talk with Dhirubhai we can propose the buy/sell concept  with RIL \\nmaking the first bid to purchase.  Enron then has the right to sell at that \\nprice or increase the bid by 5% and RiL must sell.  Since we are now in the \\ncontrol position the 10% tax logic we talked about yesterday no longer is \\nvalid, so I would describe the 5% as a control premium.  The only reason we \\nwant the buy option is in the event they offer a very low number.  I would \\nsuspect them to bid in the $550 to $650 million range.  They just turned down \\nmy offer to purchase their assets at $450mm and indicated we were \\nsubstantially below their value when I tried to engage them in a dialogue.  \\nThey know Enron paid $620 million just 12 months ago for the same position.  \\nWe know they internally have reserves booked higher than ours and have a \\nstrong desire to have a substantial upstream position that they can control.  \\nIt is possible that RIL would bid less than $500 million but I put that \\nprobability at less than one percent.  This reduces Enron's risk dramatically \\nand increases our probability of getting all of our objectives met. We also \\nget an added benefit, from pitching the deal with RIL as the first bidder,  \\nbecause this will  strengthen the perception that we (Enron) want to be the \\nbuyer, which is a key perception to have a fair auction with only one \\nlegitimate buyer, Reliance.  \\n\\nIf we  pitch the deal as suggested above,  we need to recognise going in that \\nthey probably want the control position as well.  I believe they would pay a \\nvery large value for these assets due to their tax position and by bidding \\nfirst they take great risk of leaving a lot of money on the table or not \\ngetting the deal at all.   I would suspect that they will at a minimum \\nsuggest we flip a coin to see who bids first.  Initially I would just say no, \\nbut we may need to deal with this issue and probably should decide early on \\nif it is a deal killer.  If we did flip a coin, we would wait until the \\ndocuments were final and the escrow agreement was signed so there would be no \\nbacking out without a penalty.  In this scenario it would actually help get a \\nmore impartial document done quicker if neither party knew the bidding \\nsequence until after the drafting was finalized.\\n\\nPay the Penalty: While it is not the way we want to do business, the worst \\ncase scenario under the proposed escrow agreement is to forfeit  $25 million \\nif we elected not to follow through in an Enron  buy scenario.   Considering \\nthe upside to the buy/sell under either sequence (Enron first or RIL first) \\nit may be worth the risk of losing the escrow under a black Friday scenario.  \\nI want to think about this over the weekend, but while I was thinking this \\nafternoon the risk reward seems to be very favorable.  \\n\\nContact someone at Janus Fund:  This was suggested yesterday and I would \\nstrongly urge you to do this if you feel comfortable making the inquiry.  \\nJanus bought approximately a  5% position in RIL about 1-2 months ago.  I \\nthink you will get a very positive report on both the cash front and their \\ndesire to make the upstream a key part of the company.\\n\\nThoughts on Non- Reliance Bidders:  I have spent a lot more time thinking \\nabout this issue.   I can talk you through the reasons, but as long as \\nReliance is involved and a western company can only purchase a 30% \\nnon-operated working interest, we will have to take a huge discount to fair \\nvalue.  I will be very surprised if we could get $450 million.  Again, going \\nto the Shell's, BG's,,,etc  early on in the process,  I believe, is a huge \\nmistake, both internally and externally.\\n\\nInformation Flow and Process:  Ken this is a very sensitive area but I feel \\ncompelled to mention this to you.  I am concerned about too many people \\nknowing our plan and strategy and possibly others wanting to branch out with \\nthe intentions of helping, but actually causing problems.  This needs to be \\nmanaged by one person, not three or four.  To meet all of our objectives this \\nhas to be an orchestrated deal from a to z.  I think you know more about my \\nbackground then most others in Enron.  I worked the E&P M&A business for 10 \\nyears and did pretty well at it.  I know the oil business and I believe that \\nis a key to getting a good deal done.  I know these assets and all of the \\ncomplex issues surrounding the assets, our subsidiaries, tax issues and the \\nbook considerations.  I'm the best person to get this deal done once you \\ndecide the risk the company is willing to take.  I know the limits of my \\nauthority and I will work within those bounds and keep the OOC completely and \\ntotally informed so proper decisions can be made when necessary. \\n\\nKen, I promise you I will use others in the company where and when \\nappropriate.  If I need help in India, I would not hesitate to ask Sanjay for \\nsuch.  However, the last thing we can afford is excess discussion in India on \\nthis deal.  If Dhirubhai agrees to the deal, we need to get a meeting set in \\nEurope at a neutral site to start the process.  My main objective is to  have \\na successful deal.  \\n\\nI have decided not to go to India so we can concentrate on moving this \\nforward.  Also, I will need your guidance on the future of the E&P plans for \\nEnron when we decide the direction we plan to take on Panna, Mukta and \\nTapti.  I have looked at the key people necessary to make this happen and can \\ntalk to you about that as well if you so desire.\\n\\nThanks\\njeff\",\n",

       " 'I wanted to provide you an update on where we stand related to several recent \\ncontribution requests.\\n\\nTom Delay\\'s Request -- We did fulfill the $10,000 request that came to us \\nfrom Tom and Christine Delay for the Fort Bend Child Advocates.  In addition, \\nwe\\'ve arranged with Heather for your family\\'s foundation to match Enron\\'s \\ngift.  I spoke directly with Christine Delay several times and they are very \\nappreciative of the gifts and our efforts to correct the initial oversight.\\n\\nYMCA --  I\\'ve had multiple conversations with Heather about a combined \\nEnron/Lay Family contribution to the YMCA.  According to Heather, you and \\nLinda have agreed to contribute $500,000 and ask that Enron match.  We are, \\nof course, willing to do that.  I am scheduling a meeting with Bill Phillips \\nof the YMCA to discuss the gift.  We will be talking to him about naming \\nopportunities as well as the YMCA\\'s consideration of extending services to \\nEnron employees at the downtown YMCA, as well as outlying facilities.  (FYI:  \\nThe downtown YMCA recently chose to cancel the agreement we\\'d had with them \\nallowing Body Shop members to utilize the facility.)\\n\\nOther Capital Campaigns -- We are currently evaluating several other capital \\ncontribution requests.  Each is outlined below.  We are proceeding in several \\nways.  First, I am scheduling a meeting with Marty Sunde to discuss EES\\'s \\ninterest in pursuing energy service agreements with these not-for-profit \\ninstitutions.  As you know, EES is focusing its current efforts on much \\nlarger scale energy portfolios.  Secondly, I am working to evaluate these \\nrequests based on the leveraging opportunities associated with each.  \\nFinally, we want to be equitable in our giving to these local campaigns as \\nwell as consistent in our giving philosophy.  We are working to balance these \\nrequests relative to each other and to our goal to transfer dollars away from \\nmulti-year gifts toward programs.\\n\\nTexas Heart Institute -- I had breakfast yesterday with Bob Devlin, Dr. \\nDenton Cooley, Jack Doherty and Meredith Long.  They shared with me plans for \\na new Texas Heart Institute building in the Medical Center.  (The building \\nwill bear a striking resemblance to our buildings -- oval in shape and bluish \\nglass.)  They are conducting a $75 million campaign -- $42 million to build \\nand equip the building and $33 million to sustain programs in research and \\neducation.  They are requesting $1 million from Enron and will allow us to \\nspecify how the gift is spent.  American General and Shell Oil Foundation \\nhave each contributed $1 million\\n\\nBaylor College of Medicine -- Amy Lee and I had lunch last week with several \\nfolks from Baylor.  They are in the midst of a campaign to fund their many \\nprograms in research and education.  We discussed opportunities to expand our \\nexisting medical-based literacy program - Prescription for Reading.  They \\nalso outlined for us numerous other sponsorship opportunities.  No specific \\ndollar amount was requested.  While several pharmaceutical companies have \\ncontributed in the $500,000 to $1 million range, most of our local peers are \\nwithin the $100,000 to $500,000 range.\\n\\nUniversity of Houston - MD Anderson Library and the Honors College -- As you \\nknow, the University is requesting $500,000 from Enron over 5 years to \\nsupport renovation of the library.  Since our call with Harriet Latimer, I\\'ve \\nconducted some research to determine what other local corporations are \\ncontributing.  Currently, no companies have made a financial commitment.  In \\nfact, only Compaq and Shell have committed at all with in-kind \\ncontributions.  While I am confident that we will support this in some way, I \\nam particularly interested in speaking with Steve Barth and Chet Gladchuck at \\nthe University to determine if the library could be rolled into the energy \\nservices agreement we are currently evaluating with the University\\'s athletic \\ndepartment.\\n\\nOn a separate note, you\\'d forwarded to me a request from the University to \\nfund a publication \"The Future of International Education:  Directions & \\nOpportunities.\"  Elyse Kalmans discussed this with her contacts at U of H.  \\nThey indicated that this was not a high priority for them and would rather \\nhave Enron commit its resources to other University endeavors, such as the \\nlibrary.  We have chosen to decline this request.\\n\\nI apologize for the length of this memo.  However, I did want to keep you \\nupdated on the status of these various requests.  I will present \\nrecommendations to you on each of these pending requests in the coming \\nweeks.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or comments, please \\ncontact me. \\n',\n",

We did meet some years ago at a conference\\n> in Houston when I was a VP of Union Gas, Ontario, Canada, which was later\\n> bought by Westcoast Energy and to which I migrated.\\n>\\n> I served as Vice President, International, of Westcoast Energy Inc. for 5\\n> years after Union Gas.  A year ago I elected to form my own consulting\\n> company when Westcoast constricted its international program in Asia, my\\n> prime area of interest at that time, to fund Alliance and their Mexican\\n> projects.  I remain on very good terms with Westcoast and have since done\\n> considerable work in Mexico for them.  Our Asia work was a real success,\\n> and we built the first Canadian power plant in China, and acquired and\\n> expanded a $550 MM US power plant in Indonesia.   Both are business and\\n> technical successes, and both were developed and built under my\\n> leadership.\\n>\\n> My current 8 month consulting assignment here in Mexico City for a large\\n> multi-national joint venture wraps up this month, and I am now seeking\\n> other employment. We would be happy to stay in Latin America/Caribbean, go\\n> back on the Asia beat, or try another geographical location.  My\\n> preference is contract work, full or part time, although I would consider\\n> full time permanent employment.  I thought perhaps Enron might have\\n> opportunities for someone with my experience and talents.\\n>\\n> My interests are primarily business development.  Although an engineer by\\n> training, I have been in the business and operations side for the last 20\\n> years.  My main area has been natural resources and energy.  I also enjoy\\n> strategy work, and apparently am good at it, judging by the results from\\n> the international plan I did as the first ever VP, International at\\n> Westcoast Energy.\\n>\\n> One item of note regarding project feasibility - while I ran Westcoast\\n> Energy\\'s Asia business development and operations, we invested (with\\n> partners) over $600 MM US in five years with a total staff of 5 (including\\n> clerical), and a write-off rate of 0.14% of capital invested - possibly a\\n> record low.   I have good systems for risk review and mitigation, and  to\\n> screen projects, countries, partners, and  agents.\\n>\\n> The contracts I have been working on in Mexico are Pemex contracts, but\\n> are similar to the contracts used by CFE for IPPs, and drafted by the same\\n> law firm,  if Rosarito is any example.  Having worked on $60 MM claims\\n> under these contracts, I am very familiar with the problems that these\\n> contracts have, the various possible interpretations, and the possible\\n> \"fixes\".   If, as I suspect, Enron are interested in more power\\n> development in the rapidly expanding/opening Mexican IPP market, I believe\\n> I could offer solid advice on the contracts, the players, and the risks.\\n>\\n> The first page of my CV is below in e-mail form.

The Web site provides patients\\n\\ninformation about diabetes and gives them tools to help manage their\\n\\ndisease.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Diabetes is a progressive, potentially debilitating disease that requires\\n\\nregular monitoring of blood sugar, blood pressure and weight, among other\\n\\nthings,\" said Doug Rude, e-commerce team leader, Eli Lilly and Company.\\n\\n\"Lillydiabetes.com can help empower patients and their families with the\\n\\ninformation and tools necessary to manage their disease and live healthier\\n\\nlives.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nLillydiabetes.com has a number of features and tools to encourage\\n\\naggressive management of diabetes.  Because diabetes is a chronic,\\n\\nprogressive disease, it is important that patients closely track their\\n\\nprogress toward better blood-sugar control, as well as the development of\\n\\ndiabetes-related complications. Those who register with the site have\\n\\naccess\\n\\nto customizable \"Measures of Control\" tools designed to help patients\\n\\nmonitor their diabetes and the complications that can arise.  The Measures\\n\\nof Control tools include:\\n\\n\\n\\n?    HbA1c Chart (blood-sugar control) ? Hemoglobin A1c test measures\\naverage blood-sugar levels over a two to three-month period.  Each time an\\nHbA1c test is done, patients can enter the value and save it as a color\\ngraph, which then can be used to track the patient\\'s progress toward better\\nblood-sugar control.\\n?    Height and Weight Index ? Excess body fat can lead to insulin\\nresistance, a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes.  This\\ntool helps patients calculate their body mass index, which is a measure of\\nbody weight relative to height.  The Web site then provides a place to save\\nthat information and chart progress toward desired weight.\\n\\n\\n?    Blood Pressure Chart ? A common complication of diabetes is high blood\\npressure, which can lead to heart disease as well as signal other\\npotentially serious problems, such as diabetic kidney disease.  This tool\\nallows patients to enter their blood pressure levels, save them and chart\\ntheir progress.\\n\\n\\nOther resources found on lillydiabetes.com include:\\n\\n\\n\\nProduct Information ?

The study\\'s primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania\\n\\nRating Scale (Y-MRS), an 11-item scale used to assess the severity of a\\n\\npatient\\'s mania. Key study endpoint findings included:\\n\\n\\n\\n?    The Zyprexa group experienced a significantly greater improvement on\\nthe Y-MRS total score than did patients treated with valproate (49% vs.\\n38%).\\n?    A greater proportion of Zyprexa patients achieved remission from manic\\nsymptoms (defined as Y-MRS Total Score < 12) compared with valproate\\npatients (47% vs. 34%).\\n?    54% of patients on Zyprexa experienced a 50% or more improvement in\\nY?MRS scores compared with 42% of the valproate patients.\\n?    Zyprexa patients demonstrated a statistically significant improvement\\nin certain Y-MRS Individual Item Scores compared with valproate patients:\\nactivity/energy (53% vs. 41%), sleep (69% vs. 45%) and language-thought\\ndisorder (49% vs. 35%).  Changes in other core symptoms of mania as defined\\nby the Y-MRS Individual Item Scores were similar for the two treatment\\ngroups.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStudy Design\\n\\nThe three-week, randomized, parallel, double-blind, acute-phase study\\n\\nexamined 251 hospitalized patients at 44 sites who met the DSM-IV criteria\\n\\nfor a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and were experiencing acute manic or\\n\\nmixed episodes. Subjects received olanzapine in a flexible dose range of 5\\n\\nto 20 mg/day (once daily) or valproate in a flexible does range of 500 to\\n\\n2,500  mg/day (multiple doses per day). The mean ending dose for Zyprexa\\n\\nwas 17 mg/day and the mean ending dose for valproate was 1500 mg/day. In\\n\\naddition, plasma levels were monitored to ensure valproate trough levels\\n\\nwere maintained within the targeted therapeutic range of 50-125 ?g/mL; the\\n\\nmean value of all levels obtained was 79.4 ?g/mL. Clinicians determined\\n\\ndosing based on each patient\\'s clinical response as well as the blood\\n\\nlevels in patients taking valproate. Lorazepam use was restricted to a\\n\\nmaximum dose of 2 mg/day, and administration was prohibited within eight\\n\\nhours of a psychiatric exam.\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Study Results\\n\\nNeither Zyprexa nor valproate induced depressive symptoms in bipolar manic\\n\\nor mixed patients.  In fact, both Zyprexa and valproate patients showed an\\n\\nimprovement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Hamilton Depression\\n\\nRating Scale (HAMD-21).  However, Zyprexa patients showed greater\\n\\nimprovement at the study endpoint in HAMD-21 scores (35% vs. 24%).  The\\n\\neffects of Zyprexa have not yet been studied in bipolar depression.\\n\\n\\n\\nZyprexa was generally well tolerated. The most common and significantly\\n\\ndifferent adverse events for Zyprexa were somnolence (39.2% vs. 20.6% for\\n\\nvalproate), dry mouth (33.6% vs. 6.3%), and increased appetite (12.0% vs.\\n\\n2.4%).  The most common adverse event for valproate was nausea (28.6% vs.\\n\\n10.4% for Zyprexa). Additional safety information for Zyprexa and valproate\\n\\ncan be obtained from their package inserts.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"These data support the value of Zyprexa as a much needed treatment\\n\\noption,\" said Mauricio Tohen, M.D., Dr. P.H., medical adviser, Lilly\\n\\nResearch Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, and lead investigator for the\\n\\nstudy.  \"The findings provide further evidence that Zyprexa effectively\\n\\nstabilizes mood in patients with bipolar disorder.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nManic symptoms occur during the manic phase of bipolar disorder, a lifelong\\n\\nillness characterized by disruptive swings in mood.  Symptoms include\\n\\nabnormal elation and/or irritability, often accompanied by an unrealistic\\n\\nbelief in one\\'s own abilities, increased sex drive, delusions and alcohol\\n\\nor drug abuse.  People with bipolar disorder also may experience mixed\\n\\nepisodes, marked by symptoms of mania and clinical depression occurring\\n\\nsimultaneously.

American Psychiatric Association, 1994.\\n\\n\\nZyprexa (olanzapine, Lilly)\\nvalproate (Depakote, Abbott)\\n\\n\\nThe study findings are particularly pertinent in light of valproate\\'s\\n\\nrecent revised black box warning from the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\nfollowing reports of life-threatening pancreatitis in both children and\\n\\nadults.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"Physicians have good reason to take these new data into account,\" said\\n\\nCarlos A. Zarate, M.D., associate professor of psychiatry and director,\\n\\nbipolar and psychotic disorders program, University of Massachusetts\\n\\nMedical Center.  \"The efficacy of Zyprexa coupled with its favorable safety\\n\\nprofile suggest that it may provide a timely treatment alternative for\\n\\npatients with bipolar disorder.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nZyprexa is indicated in the United States for the management of the\\n\\nmanifestations of psychotic disorders as demonstrated in short-term\\n\\nclinical trials with schizophrenia patients.  It is also approved for the\\n\\nshort-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar\\n\\ndisorder.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the original schizophrenia registration trials, olanzapine was generally\\n\\nwell tolerated.  However, as with all medications, olanzapine was\\n\\nassociated with some side effects.  In the original six-week, acute-phase\\n\\nschizophrenia trials, the most common treatment-emergent adverse event\\n\\nassociated with olanzapine was somnolence.  Other common events were\\n\\ndizziness, weight gain, constipation, akathisia (restlessness), and\\n\\npostural hypotension.  Modest elevations of prolactin were also seen,\\n\\nalthough mean changes from baseline to endpoint were not statistically\\n\\nsignificantly different between olanzapine and placebo.  A small number of\\n\\npatients experienced asymptomatic elevations of hepatic transaminase; none\\n\\nof these patients developed jaundice or drug-induced hepatitis.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn short-term (three- and four-week) acute bipolar mania trials, the most\\n\\ncommon treatment-emergent adverse event associated with olanzapine was\\n\\nsomnolence.  Other common events were dry mouth, dizziness, asthenia,\\n\\nconstipation, dyspepsia, increased appetite, and tremor.\\n\\n\\n\\nLilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing\\n\\nportfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest\\n\\nresearch from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with\\n\\neminent scientific organizations.

The OPIC \\nauthorization bill was passed by a big margin, the Defense Appropriation bill \\ngiving the President authority to extend the exemptions on India sanctions, \\nsuccess with the Trade Adjustment Act language important to a problem raised \\n\"recently\" by PGE, good news on Cong.

Our \\nUS WTO Energy Services Coalition grew to 40 members and next week we lead the \\nUS-Bolivia Business Partnership on its trip to Bolivia to meet with President \\nBanzer and others in the Bolivian political and business leadership. \\n\\nAt Enron, Ken frequently cites the Enron people who involve themselves in \\nmaking things happen.

John Hardy working from material prepared by Kelly Kimberly on the \\nCuiba update (the House International Relations Committee senior staff was \\nworried that it could be used to support some adverse amendment) preped the \\nstaff and drafted a one-pager answer sheet.

In the early 90\\'s the System had the opportunity to\\nacquire a license for ITFS spectrum and declined.\\n\\nThe ITFS spectrum is a closed circuit system that covers a relatively small\\nradius of 10-20 miles.

In this\\nlight, I read the recent article in the Wall Street Journal suggesting that\\nthe Kuht-TV spectrum allotment includes substantial unused bandwidth which\\nwe are legally permitted to lease to the private sector.  The Journal, based\\non the recent UK auction, extrapolated the overall worth of the bandwidth at\\n$160 billion.  Needless to say, if we could realize a small fraction of\\nthat, for something from which we currently derive nothing, it could be a\\nhuge boost to our efforts to obtain the additional funding we need as we\\nmove to Tier One status.\\n\\nSince Enron is the leader in the market for bandwidth, I was hoping you or\\nsomeone at Enron could give us some advice on what we own, its value, if\\nany, and how we might think about realizing on any such value.

       " \"To: Ken Lay, Jeffrey Skilling and the Enron Advisory Council\\nFrom : Gavyn Davies, Goldman Sachs\\n\\nRe - The Global Oil Price Shock\\n\\n\\nSince our meeting in Houston, the spike in world oil prices has gripped the\\nattention of financial markets. I attach a paper which analyses the genesis\\nof the present oil price increase, the likelihood of it proving permanent,\\nand the probable impact on the world economy.\\n\\nThe bottom line is the following:\\n\\n1. The recent increase in the oil price has been due fundamentally to\\nan increase in global demand, and not to the activities of OPEC, operating\\nas an oil cartel. In fact, OPEC does not seem to have enough immediate\\nsupply headroom to make much difference to the situation for many months.\\nThe danger of shortages will therefore be very acute this winter, even with\\nnormal weather conditions. This could lead to temporary spikes in the price\\nto well over $40/barrel. We see a similar situation, or worse, developing in\\nnatural gas.\\n\\n2. However, we do not see this situation as permanent. In terms of deep\\nfundamentals, the equilibrium price for oil in the long term is still only\\nabout $18/barrel. Within about 12 months, a large increase in the supply of\\noil should push prices back down again, possibly quite sharply. Our present\\nforecast for the average oil price in 2001 is $27/barrel, somewhat below\\ntoday's spot price levels. But we do not expect to see this oil price\\ndownturn before next summer.\\n\\n3. If oil prices do indeed average $27/bl in 2001, this will prove to\\nbe an oil shock for the developed economies which is the same in magnitude\\nas the Gulf War shock a decade ago. It will reduce net disposable income for\\nthe OECD economies by about 0.7%, and add about 0.9% to headline inflation\\nnumbers. All of these effects will already be in the data by about 2000 Q4,\\nso on our main forecast there should be little or no further adverse effects\\nthrough 2001.\\n\\n4. On this oil price scenario, GDP growth in the developed economies\\nwill slow from about 3.9% in 2000 to about 3.4% in 2001 - not a bad\\nout-turn.\\n\\n5. What if the oil price sustains $40/bl next year? This would give us\\nanother round of effects about the same as those mentioned in para (3)\\nabove. Even then, however, these effects should not be enough to push the\\nworld into recession. Growth should still be adequate at about 2.5-3.0%.\\n\\n6. The main risks to this conclusion are that a spike in oil prices,\\nand possible oil shortages, this winter cause a drop in equity prices, and a\\nlarge dip in business and consumer confidence. This could then lead to a\\nmore pronounced downturn in GDP next year, especially if it triggers the\\nkind of correction in the US that Larry and I have been worrying about for a\\nlong time. But this should prove just about avoidable, assuming sensible\\npolicy responses..\\n\\n7. This may therefore all work out a bit like the winter of 1998/99.\\nGoing into the winter, events occur which make people worry about recession.\\nBusiness and consumer confidence, and equity markets, take a dip. But then\\nthings improve, and it all turns out to be a buying opportunity.\\n\\n8. I hope so, anyway!\\n\\n\\nBest wishes,\\n\\nGavyn\\n\\n ,2000 Goldman, Sachs & Co.

Our goal with the ad \\ncampaign is to increase Enron\\'s familiarity and favorability with business \\nand government opinion leaders.  We want to do that by communicating the \\ninnovative culture at Enron that always asks the question, \"Why?\"  When we \\nheard businesses blaming poor financial performance on their inability to \\nmanage weather risks, we asked, \"Why?\"  We answered that with our weather \\nderivatives product that helps companies protect revenues from unfavorable \\nweather.  Now, many equity analysts and other investors are challenging \\ncompanies that don\\'t use weather derivatives as a risk management tool.\\n\\nIn order to get our message across in a cluttered advertising environment, we \\nneed to create compelling images to get that message accross.  The use of a \\ntraditional symbol (the old cork gun shooting gallery) applied in a \\nnon-traditional way (shooting down conventional wisdom) gets the point across \\nvery directly that traditional excuses don\\'t \"stand up\" to today\\'s markets.  \\nI think it\\'s a powerful, and humorous, symbolic message.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry if you\\'re taking the reference to an old-fashioned game literally.  \\nI can assure you that no ducks or CEOs were harmed in the making of the \\ncommercial.  \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJoe Sutton\\n\\n(Obviously, you can delete the smart-alecky last sentence.)',\n",

The=\\n=20\\nresult is much better information (attendance, grading, assignments,=20\\nmessages, etc.) but the schools only need a simple computer with a browser =\\nto=20\\naccess the service.

       " \"Ken and Mark,\\n\\nRichard Lewis mentioned to me that you had recently read an article about \\nRegenesys, the large-scale battery technology being developed in the UK, and \\nwanted to know more about Enron's potential interest in this technology.  I \\nam a Manager in our UK Origination and have tracked the progress of Regenesys \\nsince it first came on the scene over one year ago.  We have watched it with \\ninterest given the historical peak/off-peak spread in this country's power \\nmarket.  Bruce Stram and I have also co-ordinated our efforts on the \\npreliminary analysis.\\n\\nBelow is a brief summary of Regenesys, our initial views on the technology \\nand our response going forward.\\n\\nTechnology Summary\\nlarge-scale battery system using two oppositely-charged electrolytes that are \\nseparated by an ion exchange membrane\\ncurrent generating plant capacity up to 14.75 MW per unit (or 120 MWh per day)\\nresponse time within 20 milliseconds\\nit can release full power within a few seconds thereby yielding brief \\ncapacity of up to 500 MW\\n$1500 / kW capital costs initially which are expected to decrease to approx. \\n$750 / kW \\n18 month build time for facility which requires a site of just under 1 \\nhectare (50 m x 60 m)\\n\\n\\nLatest Developments\\nInnogy announced last month that it will proceed with it's first Regenesys \\nplant at Aberthaw Power Station in the UK\\nTennessee Valley Authority has just signed some form of agreement with Innogy \\non the Regenesys technology but there are no firm decisions to build a unit \\nthere yet\\n\\nOur Cynical Point of View\\nInnogy have got to go a long way before they can make this technology \\ncommercially successful\\nOur initial analysis shows that based on the peak/off-peak spreads they need \\nto achieve capital costs less than $600 / kW to be successful - we have not \\nseen evidence that this can be achieved\\nInnogy have been hyping up the technology in the past month to support the \\nforthcoming spilt of National Power and to prepare for a potential floatation\\nThere has been a flurry of press releases and news articles recently yet the \\nspecifications of the technology (including capital cost) have not improved \\nsince we first looked at this in July 1999\\nInnogy touts this as a revolution in energy storage for peak/off-peak \\narbitrage, however, commercially it does not compare to having large-scale \\ndiesel standby generation\\n\\nOn the Brighter Side\\nThe real potential for this technology could be in supporting grid systems \\nIt has good black start and frequency response capabilities\\n\\nWay Forward\\nWe are evaluating the commercial attraction of the black start and frequency \\nresponse characteristics with respect to our interests in the UK\\nI will continue to liaise with Bruce Stram in evaluating any further \\npotential in the US\\n\\nPlease let me know if you would like any further details on the above.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nChris\",\n",

We have\\ndiscussed that term sheet with the partners, believing it to be the deal,\\nand they have approved the garage loan on those terms.\\n\\nJohn and I believe that the comments on the term sheet that you, James\\nHernandez and Mike Bartolotta have provided us recently constitute a\\nsignificant departure from the Enron Field deal.

While we\\nwho pay for it all, draw an average of $1000/month from Social Security.\\nImagine for a moment that you could structure a retirement plan so\\ndesirable that people would have extra deducted so that they could\\nincrease their own personal retirement income. A retirement plan that\\nworks so well, that  Railroad employees, Postal Workers, and others who\\naren\\'t in it, would clamor to get in. That is how good Social Security\\ncould be, if only one small change were made. That change is to jerk the\\nGolden Fleece retirement out from under the Senators and Congressmen,\\nand put them in Social Security with the rest of us. Then watch how fast\\nthey fix it.

       " 'Dear Ken,\\n\\nI\\'d like to thank you for your continued participation in this project.\\n\\nI thought it would make sense to quickly recap where we are following last\\nweek\\'s meeting.\\n\\n1. We will redraft the report to reflect several trains of thought.  We\\nwill, for example, express a greater appreciation for the fact that there\\nare major problems with the current financial reporting framework, a big gap\\nbetween GAAP and the real world in which investors must make their\\njudgements.  We will devote much more attention to the issue of intangibles,\\nincluding the need for a common language to describe them.  We will\\nelaborate on the issue of the environment for disclosure, suggesting that we\\nneed a way of thinking about the concept of safe harbor, one which is based\\non the notion that the way to protect investors amid so much uncertainty is\\nto make it easier for companies to provide forward looking information,\\nknowing that no one can be fully confident of any projections these days.\\nWe will be much bolder in recommending several groups - the SEC, FASB,\\ninstitutional investors - take a much greater interest in the deficiencies\\nof the reporting model and ask the questions, commission the studies, etc.\\n\\nAll of this will still be within the framework of the spirit of the last\\ndraft - that is, we\\'re against more regulation at this time, against\\nprescriptive one-size-fits-all mandates, etc.  And we believe that the\\nmarket is forcing disclosure already - but maybe not quickly or\\ncomprehensively enough.\\n\\n2. Some of the panel members will have supplementary views.  Can you\\nbegin to put pen to paper now?  Here is my speculation as to who may want to\\nsay what:\\n\\n* Len Baker and Rob Glaser may wish to write something on the recent\\n\"Fair Disclosure\" decision.  I sense that Dennis Powell might wish to join.\\nLen, can you take the lead?  I\\'d suggest no more than one page, preferably\\nhalf a page.\\n\\n* John Neff may wish to express skepticism about the value of\\ndeveloping a new language for intangibles.\\n\\n* John Doerr and Len Baker may wish to say something about accounting\\nfor pooling or stock options.  Again, please keep it very short.  John, can\\nyou take the lead?\\n\\nIf anyone else is thinking about a supplementary view, please let me know.\\nWe would appreciate these submissions by October 15.\\n\\n3. Future Schedule.  We agreed to \"get it right\" and not to stop until\\nwe do.   The next steps, it seems to me are:\\n\\n* Get you a new draft\\n* Get your views either in a meeting or conference call to be\\nscheduled\\n* See where we are then\\n\\nHowever, I\\'d like to suggest that we aim to finish this report by December\\n15, 2000 if at all possible.\\n\\nPlease let me know if I\\'ve missed anything or if you have additional ideas.\\n\\nBest regards,\\nJeff\\n\\n',\n",

Advance communication allows you to avoid situations that may have\\n   legal consequences, or if not, at least may cause embarassment.\\n\\n2.   We prepare for you the required reports of the transaction to the SEC.\\n\\nIf you had any Lilly stock transactions in September, please advise me as\\nsoon as possible.

Let me\\nfill you in with some more background information about us.\\nI am the founder of DDI (the second largest wireline and wireless private\\ntelecom operator in Japan). Today\\'s DDI market capitalization is around $20\\nbillion. I left DDI at the end of 1995 and became a professor and Keio\\nUniversity Business School for 4 years. I have also been an active member in\\nthe government telecom deregulation committee. I left Keio University last\\nyear and founded eAccess in November 1999. With less than one year in\\noperation, eAccess has already established a strong presence in the Japanese\\ntelecom market. We have three phases in our long-term business plan, (1)\\nbroadband access network; (2) CSP and ASP streaming related business; (3) IP\\nmetropolitan backbone infrastructure business. As we are currently looking\\nfor the best global strategic partner to achieve the goal together, we\\nbelieve that Enron could become a strong potential partner in Japan.\\n\\nIf you need any more information about eAccess, please do not hesitate to\\ncall or email me.\\nI am looking forward to seeing you on October 13.\\n\\nRegards\\n\\nDr. Sachio Semmoto\\n\\nPS : Please advise me email addresses of Messrs.

Bush Debate Win/Al Gore\\'s Lies\\n\\nI hope you got a chance to see the debate last night.  George W. Bush did a\\nvery good job articulating his message and debating Al Gore.\\n\\nI am sure it will come as no surprise to you that Al Gore could not go the\\nentire debate without telling a lie.  In fact, two lies have been exposed so\\nfar.\\n\\nThe first one was Gore\\'s claim that he visited Texas with FEMA Director,\\nJames Lee Witt, after the bad Texas floods and tornadoes.  As it turns out,\\nthat was a lie.  Al Gore on the morning news shows today claimed that he\\nthought he had, but it must have been another state.  Go figure.\\n\\nThe next lie exposed is as follows:\\n\\nNews radio 970 WFLA interviewed the principal of Sarasota High this morning.\\nHe said that the girl that Gore was talking about had no desk for exactly\\none day.  It was the first day of class and they were still making\\nadjustments to the kids class schedule and that particular classroom was\\nbeing refurbished.  The teacher only had to call the office and get her a\\ndesk because they have plenty of desks there.  Apparently there is a picture\\nthat was sent to Gore of her standing in class or something like that\\nbecause the Principal mentions that in the picture of her there is $100,000\\nof new equipment behind her.\\n\\nPlease pass this along to your friends and family and any undecided voters.\\nThe more people who realize that Al Gore is a pathological liar, the better\\nGeorge W. Bush will do.\\n\\nPlease check out the two links and cast your vote for George W. Bush as the\\nwinner in last night\\'s debate:  http://news.excite.com/news/poll/ or\\nhttp://www.cnn.com/\\n\\nLast but not least....Have you done everything you can do to elect George W.\\nBush?  Have you made a small contribution to Victory 2000?  Have you\\nparticipated in a literature drop for the GOP Ticket or made phone calls on\\nits behalf?  If not, please let me know.\\n\\nThanks for your support.\\n\\nPaid for by Victory 2000\\n\\n***To unsubscribe from these Victory 2000 Updates, please simply respond to\\nthis email with \"unsubscribe\" typed into the subject line and your name will\\nbe removed.***',\n",

       " 'Ken, we met a while back--\\'94 or so--when I was editor of Fortune. It\\'s in\\nmy current incarnation, though, as Editorial Director for the Harvard\\nBusiness School Publishing Co. and head of its publishing division--we\\npublish the Harvard Business Review, HBS Press books (including Leading the\\nRevolution from your friend and skiing companion Gary Hamel), and the best\\nselling management newsletter in the country, among other things--that I\\nwanted to put a proposition before you to see if we might interest you in\\nwhat I think may be an important idea-development and publishing\\nopportunity.\\nHBSPC has become quite interested in the subject of corporate venturing, of\\nhow companies can invest in innovation and new organizational forms (but you\\nknow all about that) in a transformative way, so much so that we\\'re planning\\nto put on a couple of conferences on the subject next year. (The purpose of\\nour conferences, in general, is to push ideas ahead and advance the thinking\\non a particular topic.) They will be smallish, half-day affairs--we\\'re\\nlooking at an audience of perhaps 75 senior executives at each--one in New\\nYork in January, the second in San Francisco, probably the first week in\\nFebruary. As with the authors of the books and HBR articles that we publish,\\nwe\\'re committed to having only top-flight experts on the program, mostly on\\npanels. (For instance, we\\'re talking with the Harvard Business School\\nprofessors who teach the executive education course on corporate venturing\\nabout their serving on and putting together one of the panels.) And we, of\\ncourse, thought of you and Enron--who knows more about the subject? As we\\'ve\\ndesigned the conferences, we\\'ve concluded that a great way to begin the\\nprogram would be to have a sort of a keynote from a CEO grounded in the\\nreal-world experience of making this happen. But we don\\'t want to impose on\\nyour time, or that of your staff, to put together a speech. Our thought was\\nto have the session be more like \"A conversation with...\", wherein an\\ninterlocutor (probably me, but maybe assisted by a couple of others) would\\nput questions to you, and draw you out on the points you thought important.\\nWe could confer on the questions beforehand as much or little as you\\'d like.\\nKen Chenault of American Express has agreed to play this role at the New\\nYork conference. We\\'d wondered if there were any possibility of interesting\\nyou in it for the San Francisco conference? Enron has the best record of any\\ncompany on this front, and my secret hope is that the conversation might\\nserve as the basis of an article (or even the first step toward a book?)\\nthat HBSP might eventually publish. We know, too, that you have endless\\ndemands on your time, and if it would help you to think more favorably of\\nusing it in this way, we\\'d be happy to provide an honararium for the charity\\nor charities of your choice.\\nI\\'m sure you\\'re besieged with emails on your return from vacation,  but if\\nyou have a moment to marinate on this, we\\'d welcome the chance to answer any\\nquestions you might have about the event. I have two offices and two phone\\nnumbers (New York, Monday, Tuesday, and most Fridays, at 212-872-9281,\\nBoston the rest of the week at 617-783-7535) but the most efficient way for\\nyour office to schedule a conversation might be to have them be in touch\\nwith Maria Carnevale here in New York at 212-872-9285) or just shoot me back\\nan email.\\nThanks for taking the time for this overlong email. Our eyes are beginning\\nto open here to the landscape shaking, transformative possibilities of\\ncorporate venturing, as became clear to you long ago.

You=\\n=01,ve=20\\nseen what technology can do at work.  Now we want you and your family to=20\\nrealize its benefits at home.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=\\nhe=20\\nClickAtHome\\nprogram, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20\\ntechnology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=\\n=20\\nclick of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=\\n=20\\nInternet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20\\n\\nWe have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=\\n=20\\nthe computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=\\n=20\\ncase you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=\\n=20\\ncomputer or Internet connection in the next few months.

Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=\\n=20\\nand regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=\\n=20\\nhowever, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=\\n,=20\\nEnron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20\\naccounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20\\nemployed at the time of implementation. =20\\n? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=\\n=20\\nthe equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=\\nry=20\\nof equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.\\n\\nDetails about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=\\n=20\\nyour initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=\\n=20\\nhttp://clickathome.enron.com.

The overall mission of Enron University Affairs is to broaden the \\ndepth and scope of our relationships with targeted universities through \\nbuilding Enron brand recognition on campuses, leveraging research exchanges \\nof intellectual capital between Enron and the Academic community, and \\nenhancing commercial opportunities for Enron.  Additionally, this initiative \\nwill further Enron\\'s efforts to hire and retain the world\\'s most innovative \\nemployees.\\n\\nI am leading this initiative, as Vice President, joined by Mike Rosen as a \\nDirector.

We are billing everyone for the hotel, golf and\\nregatta this week and we have a few questions.  The hotel and golf are easy.\\nHowever the regatta is a different situation.  When we started this project,\\nthe cost of the regatta was much less than when we finished.  We quoted\\n$85.00 per person, however the Millennium rate was actually $100.00 per\\nperson.  This would not be such a great problem, however we had 33 no-shows\\nfor the regatta.  This being said, we have two choices.  We bill those that\\nsailed for an additional $15.00 to make their charge $100.00 which then\\nleaves us with a negative $3500.00.  Or, we also bill the 33 no-shows for\\n$100.00 each which puts us pretty close to break even.\\nIn the big picture, there have been some budget cost that were less than\\nexpected and some that were more.  We will have the final budget complete by\\nthe end of next week.\\nThe most important issue, is it acceptable to bill those that sailed $100.00\\nor do you want us to stay at the original price of $85.00?......Then, of\\ncourse, what should we do about the no shows?  Possibly bill them a\\ncancellation fee or the full fee?  Or, forget and forgive this time?\\nI am leaving for Paradise tomorrow, however my trusted partner Janelle will\\nbe here until the 20th of January.

The House passed the conference reports on\\nthe energy, interior and transportation appropriations bills.   We\\nalso passed a continuing resolution agreement that will keep the\\ngovernment running until all 13 appropriations bills are passed and\\nsigned into law by the president.\\n\\nOn Monday of this week, as Chairman of the Congressional Results\\nCaucus and a member of the Congressional Cyber Security Caucus, I\\ntoured the high-tech corridor of Boston, Massachusetts today to learn\\nabout high-tech issues such as information security, e-signature\\nlegislation and Internet taxation.\\n\\nI organized the trip to draw attention to the need for more implementation\\nof information technology security not only among federal and other\\ngovernmental agencies but in the private sector as well.  The Congressional\\nCyber Security Caucus exists in part to educate other members of\\nCongress and government agencies of the vital need for secure information\\ntechnology systems.\\n\\nThe trip came on the heels of a recent General Accounting Office\\n(GAO) report to Congress that clearly stated that too many government\\noperations and assets remain at risk of cyber attack.  The GAO discovered\\nserious security flaws at major federal agencies such as the Treasury\\nDepartment and the Department of Defense - situations clearly indicating\\nlarge potential threats to citizen privacy and national security.\\n\\nSome of the computer systems that run our national defense and military\\noperations are literally an open target to hostile nations or terrorists\\nwho have cyber terrorism technology.  Both accidental and intentional\\nattacks on these very systems have been detected and we must take\\nsteps to stop them.\\n\\nI was joined by Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-CA), Congressman\\nTom Davis (R-VA), Congressman Pete Hoekstra (R-MI), Congresswoman\\nNancy Johnson (R-CT), Congressman John Sununu (R-NH), Congressman\\nJack Quinn (R-NY), Congressman John Sweeney (R-NY), and other prominent\\nbusiness, community and financial leaders.\\n\\nWe attended a meeting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\\nwith area CEOs and high-tech leaders, representing the financial,\\ncommunications and technology community.  The discussion was hosted\\nby TechNet Massachusetts to discuss creating digital opportunities,\\nH-1B visas, protection of online privacy, and taxation of Internet\\ntransactions.\\n\\nI believe that any government agency using information systems and\\nis linked to the outside world MUST have an efficient and secure\\ninformation security system.  The potential privacy and security\\nthreat is not something we should take lightly and unfortunately\\ntoo many high-level government officials are doing just that!\\n\\nAny major business, industry or government organization must consider\\nthe threat of cyber attack and how it could be a devastating situation\\nto customers and citizens.

The bill passed in the U.S. House of Representatives\\nby a vote of 352-75.\\n\\nThe tremendous growth of e-commerce has created thousands of high-wage\\njobs in this country and has led to countless new choices for Texas\\nconsumers.  The group with me today believes the New Economy should\\nremain unfettered by burdensome taxes and regulation, to ensure continued\\ngrowth and innovation into the 21st century.\\n\\nAround Texas...\\n\\nLast Friday, I spoke to the advanced placement Government and Economics\\nclasses at Palestine High School.  I pointed out to them that our\\nConstitutional form of government is really just an on-going experiment,\\nand that the continued success of our country depends on the participation\\nof all of our citizens.  I told them that I am confident that we\\ncan solve every problem in America.  I always enjoy speaking with\\nenthusiastic young people, and I want to give every student an opportunity\\nto experience and understand our government.\\n\\nOn Saturday I went to the St. Thomas - Aquinas children\\'s carnival,\\nand that evening I attended a fundraising event to benefit \"For the\\nLove of the Lake.\"  This is one of my favorite community projects.\\n I have adopted part of the shoreline of White Rock Lake, and would\\nencourage all of you to come help out at our \"Second Saturday Clean-up.\"\\n See my web site for more information.\\n\\nTomorrow I will see my friends in Anderson County at the Anderson\\nCounty Cattle Baron\\'s Ball.

Awareness of Environmental Issue\\n1)   Environmental issue, like Global warming, Excessive use of\\nnatural resources, Recycling, Pollution, is of major significance.\\nThe impact on the business is becoming to increase.\\n2)   The Kyoto Conference(COP3) defined an international framework\\nfor dealing with the issue of global warming.\\n(The GHG reduction targets contained in the Kyoto Protocol are 6%\\nfor Japan, 7% for the U.S.A., 8% for the EU)\\nSpecific content for the Flexibility Mechanism/Kyoto Mechanism\\n(for International Emissions Trading (IET), Joint Implement (JI),\\nand Clean Development Mechanism(CDM)) will be decided on at COP6,\\nwhich is scheduled for November 2000.\\n     GHG is a serious matter requiring a globally studying.\\n\\n2. GHG Reduction\\n1)   The relationship between GHG levels and climatic change\\nremains uncertain at present and further research is required.\\nPolicies will have to be devised that take account of developments\\nin scientific knowledge and opinion and that also maintains\\nflexibility.\\n2)   Policy on GHG reduction must reflect the circumstances of\\neach country and be based on a combination of regulatory measures,\\neconomic measures and voluntary measures.\\n     Excessive regulating may cause the unfairness in business\\ncompetition.\\n\\n3. Energy Conservation\\n1)   The U.S.A. is the largest consumer of energy. In such a\\nlarge, mobile country, much\\nconsumption is accounted for by the transportation sector.\\n2)   The EU has pushed many advances in environmental protection,\\nand has seen considerable progress in the use of renewable energy.\\n\\n3)   Japan has very limited natural resources, and energy\\nconservation has been promoted since the oil shocks of the 1970s.\\nAs a result, Japan is a leader in making effective use of energy,\\nand has the lowest level of GHG emissions against GDP.\\nJapan\\'s policy is to combine regulation with voluntary measures.\\nIndustry has supported this by promoting voluntary environmental\\nplans and other measures.\\nJapanese industries including Toshiba are to improve the energy\\nconsumption efficiency of their products and use of energy at\\ntheir factories.\\n\\n4. Programme of Industry\\n1)   Energy conservation is to make up the cost reduction of\\nproducts and recycling will bring about the effect on manufacturing\\ncost saving in the long run.\\n\\n>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>\\n(See attached file: Einvironmentalissue0118.doc)\\n\\n   Hitoshi Misaki, Group Manager\\n   Relations-Group,\\n   International Division TOSHIBA CORPORATION\\n   1-1,Shibaura 1-chome Minatoku Tokyo\\n   JAPAN 105-8001\\n   TEL:03-3457-3661, FAX:03-5444-9217\\n   e-mail:hitoshi misaki@toshiba.co.jp\\n   YES T can !\\n\\n - Einvironmentalissue0118.doc\\n\\n',\n",

       " \"Ken,\\n\\nEarlier this year when the decision was made to purchase our new GV aircraft, \\nwe agreed to move forward with plans to sell one of our Falcon 900B's by \\nyear-end.\\n\\nThis allows for Aviation to maintain a six aircraft domestic fleet, once the \\nGV is delivered and operational at the beginning of the 2nd quarter of next \\nyear.  Our '01 budget forecast is based on this assumption.\\n\\nA year-end sale avoids ad valorem tax issues.  It reduces our fleet to five \\nduring the 1st quarter, which is also the limit that we can operate aircraft, \\ni.e., several pilots unavailable (at GV flight training during this period).\\n\\nGary Fitch advises that Jeff and Joe do not have a preference on which \\naircraft to sell.  Gary prefers selling the Falcon 900B (#N5733), since it \\nhas only one lavatory.  The aircraft is 12 years old, in excellent condition, \\nand has a market value of $20-22 million (lease buy-out of $19 million).\\n\\nWith your concurrence, we will contract with an aircraft broker and place the \\nFalcon on the market.\\n\\nBill\",\n",

       " 'Hi Ken,\\n\\nI read with interest today about Enron on your corporate web site and your\\nrecognition as one of the top U.S. CEOs. Such success usually results from a\\nhistory of strong business and customer relationships. With this in mind, I\\nfelt compelled to bring my one and only experience with Enron to your\\nattention.\\n\\nI am President, CEO of Xign Corporation located in Pleasanton, CA.  Our\\ncompany is developing software for electronic payments.  Our board of\\ndirectors includes Charles Schwab and Bob Kimmitt (former U.S. Ambassador to\\nGermany and President of Commerce One).\\n\\nOur company signed an intent last June with Enron to sublease an office\\nbuilding.  My team worked in good faith with Enron people for 5 months\\nwaiting for a draft lease.  During this period we were delayed time and\\nagain by \"lack of legal resources\" to complete the contract.  Last month we\\nwere told that Enron still wanted to lease the space, but the vacancy would\\nbe delayed one month (from the original October 15th date).  Two weeks ago\\nwe were told that a November date was at risk and the lease could not be\\nsigned.\\n\\nThis week the Enron representative told us (1) there is no occupancy date\\nthat can be established and (2) Enron is not willing or interested in\\ntelling us when we they can set a date.  End of conversation.\\n\\nOur company has pursued this matter for six months with assurances by Enron\\nof their intention to move forward in good faith.  My company is now down to\\n100 days in our current lease in a market with very little available space.\\nThis will materially effect our operation and our shareholders.  Enron did\\nnot legally commit to the lease. But continued reassurances of the intent to\\nsign the lease, misled us.  We won\\'t make a similar mistake in the future.\\n\\nWe all operate as members of a business community.  I\\'m sure my experience\\nwith Enron is not reflective of your organization as a whole. I would\\ncertainly appreciate if you could have someone look into this matter and\\nlet us know if there might be a solution to this situation that works well\\nfor all parties.\\n\\nThank you very much,\\n\\n\\nTom Glassanos\\nPresident, CEO\\nXign Corporation\\n(925) 876-2326\\n\\n',\n",

       " 'Ken, my deepest thanks again for attending and speaking at the Davenport\\nSociety banquet program this Friday night.  At the end of this e-mail is\\nyour portion of the \"script\" for this event.  The entire script will be in a\\nnotebook at the podium.\\n\\nBesides introductions (primarily some of our students who will be there),\\nthe program will include remarks from the chancellor, the induction of new\\nmembers of the Society, announcements of other large new gifts, and some\\nmusical entertainment.  Jack and Mary Bush of Dallas, Texas are co-chairs of\\nthe Davenport Society this year.  Both are MU alums.  Jack retired several\\nyears ago as president of Michaels Store, the large arts-and-crafts\\nretailer; he\\'s now involved in retail and e-commerce consulting.\\n\\nWe will have at least 225 alumni, business people from the area, university\\nleaders, faculty, staff, and students in attendance.  A couple reminders:\\nIt is black tie.  And the event is being held at the Reynolds Alumni Center\\non campus, with reception at 6 and dinner at 7.  We intend/hope to end by\\n9:30.\\n\\nYou will be introduced by Jack Bush.  As you can see below, we have allotted\\nabout 10 minutes for the keynote talk.  The starting time for your talk is\\napproximate, but we strive to stay on schedule.  Last Friday, I responded to\\nan e-mail from Rob Bradley regarding your keynote talk.  He indicated that\\nhe would be preparing the talk.  (Rob, would you confirm that you received\\nmy e-mail of last Friday.  Thanks.)\\n\\nThen we will have another 10 minutes or so devoted to the announcement of\\nthe Pinkney Walker Professorship.  As you can see, I\\'ll introduce this part\\nafter thanking you for your keynote remarks.  The professorship plaque that\\nwill hang in the foyer of Middlebush Hall (and, soon, Cornell Hall) has\\narrived so we will be able to show it to the audience and to Pinkney.  We\\'ll\\nhave it on stage and I\\'ll hold it while you read the wording (see below).\\n\\nIf you desire, you can add personal comments about Pinkney after reading the\\ninscription on the plaque.  If you want them placed in the podium script,\\njust have them sent to me via e-mail; likewise, with any changes or\\ncorrections to the portion below.  Of course, you can speak extemporaneously\\nabout Pinkney or bring prepared remarks about him with you.  Then we\\'ll\\nallow Pinkney to say a few words.  It should be splendid.\\n\\nBy the way, during the dinner, you will be seated with Pinkney and his wife\\nSheila, Dulari Mehta (a College of Business student from the Dallas area who\\nis hosting the Walkers, who are new Davenport Society members), Richard\\nSchwartz (dean of A&S), and Michael Kateman and Lindsay Lopez (both from the\\nA&S development office)\\n\\nOf course, if you, Rob, or Rosalee have questions, you can call either my\\nassistant Carol Ritter or me at 573/882-6688.

Walker Endowment would be dedicated to building\\nexcellence in the college.\\n\\nBut we didn\\'t know if the endowment eventually would fund a scholarship or\\ntwo, faculty research, or a faculty position.\\n\\nThat would depend on how much money was raised.\\n\\nWell, tonight, as Paul Harvey would say, Ken is back with the rest of the\\nstory.\\n\\nKen. . .\\n\\n\\nKen Lay: It is with great pride and pleasure that I can tell you\\ntonight that the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment has received gifts totaling\\n$550,000, which means it will fund a distinguished professorship in the\\ncollege.\\n\\nHere is the plaque that will hang in Middlebush Hall and eventually will be\\nmoved to Cornell Hall.\\n\\nIt reads:\\n\\nPinkney C. Walker Distinguished Teaching Professorship\\nCollege of Business\\n\\nEstablished in recognition of Dr. Walker\\'s teaching excellence\\nand his significant contributions as dean, public servant, and friend.\\n\\nEndowed in 2000 by alumni and friends of the University of Missouri.\\n\\nPinkney, please accept our congratulations.\\n\\nWould you like to say a few words.\\n\\n[Pinkney Walker comes to podium]\\n\\n\\n8:36 - 8:41  PINKNEY WALKER PERSONAL REMARKS\\n\\nPinkney Walker: [Remarks]\\n\\n[Jack and Mary Bush come to podium; Bruce Walker, Pinkney Walker and Ken Lay\\nreturn to seats.]',\n",

In\\na humorous ad campaign developed by the Appliance Standards Awareness\\nproject and featuring Energy Secretary Bill Richardson in digitally-inserted\\nsunglasses, energy efficiency advocates, urge strong air conditioner\\nstandards. Air conditioners are the largest single contributors to peak\\nelectricity demand - an issue the past two summers as peak demands created\\nand threatened blackouts and brownouts in various locations. This proposed\\nlegislation is currently in a 60-day public comment period, allowing for\\ninput from interested parties, after which the DOE will issue the final\\nrule.\\n\\nhttp://www.ase.org/media/newsrel/press.htm\\n\\nTo see four flaws in the DOE analysis:\\nhttp://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/doeflaws.htm\\n\\nTo send an email to Secretary of Energy Richardson urging strong air\\nconditioner standards:\\nhttp://www.standardsasap.org/accac.htm\\n\\nTo view the ad, visit the Appliance Standard Awareness Project at:\\nhttp://www.standardsasap.org/wpad.pdf\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nWinter Fuel Outlook Bleak, EIA Reveals in New Report\\n\\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts that natural gas prices\\nwill increase by as much as 40 to 50 percent for consumers this winter over\\nlast winter, or an average of $240 per consumer home, in its Winter Fuels\\nOutlook, released on October 6. Home heating oil prices are expected to rise\\nby $190 per home from last year\\'s already high prices in the Northeast,\\nwhile electricity prices could increase by as much as 12 percent.\\nPredictions are based on normal winter weather, and prices could escalate\\neven further should the weather prove to be colder than normal.\\n\\nGet the complete EIA report at:\\nhttp://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/contents.html\\n\\nCheck out the Alliance to Save Energy\\'s new white paper web section on\\nenergy prices:\\nhttp://www.ase.org/energyprices\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nGains Expected in Federal Budget for Energy Efficiency Programs\\n\\nHolding a strong hand due to concerns over sharply rising energy prices and\\nlow winter natural gas and heating oil inventories, and backed by a strong\\nlobbying effort from the Alliance to Save Energy  and others, the Clinton\\nadministration is expected to win substantial gains for energy efficiency\\nprograms in recently concluded negotiations with Congressional appropriators\\nover the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Environmental Protection\\nAgency budget. A total of $814 million is being appropriated for energy\\nefficiency research, development and deployment programs, run by the DOE\\'s\\nOffice of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, in increase of $94\\nmillion, or 13 percent over the previous budget.\\n\\nFor more information:\\nhttp://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/fedbudget.htm\\n\\nCheck this link regularly over the next few weeks as we update this\\ninformation based on Congressional and Presidential action.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nAvoid Home Energy $ticker $hock\\n\\nIf you thought it was expensive to pay up to $2 a gallon for gas this\\nsummer, you\\'ll have continued \"$ticker $hock\" when your home energy bills\\narrive this winter with predicted increases.

Two bills extend California\\'s system benefits charge\\nthrough 2012, while adding an inflation adjustment, creating more than $5\\nbillion of investment in clean energy from 2002-2012. This may be the\\nlargest clean energy fund ever created. A third major bill will speed the\\nadoption of cost-effective buildings and appliance standards. These measures\\nare expected to maximize peak energy savings for the summer of 2001, and to\\nlessen future energy reliability problems.\\n\\nTo see complete bill texts:\\nhttp://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/sen/sb_1151-1200/sb_1194_bill_20000831_enrol\\nled.html\\n\\n\\nhttp://info.sen.ca.gov/pub/bill/asm/ab_0951-1000/ab_970_bill_20000831_enroll\\ned.html\\n\\nAnd in Los Angeles, the City Council approved a 10-year power plan that will\\nmeet roughly half of the 1000 megawatts of new power capacity with renewable\\nenergy sources, distributed generation, and demand side management.\\n\\nhttp://www.ase.org/e-FFICIENCY/losangeles.htm\\n\\nThe New York State Public Service Commission has proposed increasing the\\nstate\\'s System Benefits Charge from its current $78 million to $139 million\\nper year, and extending it for five years. About 70 percent of the current\\n$78 million is used for energy efficiency programs. If this formula holds,\\nefficiency funding would increase to about $97 million - an 80 percent\\nincrease from current levels.

       " 'This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20\\nEnron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=\\n=20\\nchallenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20\\nindividually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=\\nes=20\\nus to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=\\n=20\\ndone, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=\\n=20\\nof the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20\\nwithin our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.\\n\\nThe primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20\\nassignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=\\nn=20\\nthe group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=\\ns=20\\nstrategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=\\nw=20\\nmentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:\\n\\n1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes\\n2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski\\n3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord\\n4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho\\n5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard\\n6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson\\n\\nWith the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=\\ned=20\\nto announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=\\n=20\\n2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20\\nleading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=\\nda=20\\nwas a Congressional staffer and partner/principal in two Washington law fir=\\nms=20\\nprior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=\\n,=20\\nthe last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public=20\\nLiaison, for Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific=20\\nbackground, both in energy and financial services, and is a welcome additio=\\nn=20\\nto our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=\\n=20\\ngroups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=\\ner=20\\nJoe Hartsoe=01,s direction will also report to Linda.  Joe Hartsoe will als=\\no=20\\nretain primary responsibility for NERC activities, although Charles Yeung a=\\nnd=20\\nDick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe=\\ns=20\\nin his capacity of directing our activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be=\\n=20\\ntransferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1s=\\nt=20\\nquarter of 2001 and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporti=\\nng=20\\nto Joe Hartsoe.\\n\\nOn a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=\\nns=20\\nthat Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=\\n. =20\\nJoe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=\\n=20\\ncompany that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=\\n=20\\nabout this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=\\nital=20\\npart of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=\\n=20\\nover the next days and weeks.\\n\\nI will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=\\n=20\\nthat Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20\\ncompanies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=\\n=20\\nstrategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=\\n=20\\nmost importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can=20\\ncontribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis. =\\n=20\\nCommunicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20\\nGovernment Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20\\nexecution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.\\n\\nIn order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20\\nAffairs organization; the following changes are being made.\\n\\nIn addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=\\n=20\\nEES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20\\nrates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.  =\\n=20\\nThis group will continue to provide valuable technical support services=20\\nthroughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise=\\n=20\\nover the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi=\\nll=20\\nsoon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati=\\non=20\\nand report to Harry.\\nJeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20\\nTwiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role=20\\nsupporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets.

A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job=\\n=20\\nin leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business Rules) process over the=\\n=20\\nlast year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO=20\\nefforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=\\n=20\\nwholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=\\nn=20\\nwill play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale=20\\nelectric market issues.  The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess=\\nes=20\\nof the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=\\n=20\\nprovide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts=\\n=20\\nacross North America.\\nTom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=\\ng=20\\nthe company=01,s efforts at PJM.

We provide you with updates of the\\nInstitute\\'s current research publications, events and media programs.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIN THIS WEEK\\'S ISSUE:\\n1. Holding Bureaucrats Personally Accountable: A 1st Amendment Victory\\n2. The Independent Review: Fall Issue Now Available\\n3. Public Health vs. The Nanny State? -- Next Independent Policy\\nForum (10/26/00)\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHOLDING BUREAUCRATS PERSONALLY ACCOUNTABLE: A 1st Amendment Victory\\n\\nThe legal doctrine of \"sovereign immunity\" -- and its modern cousin,\\n\"qualified immunity\" -- has historically allowed government\\nbureaucrats to escape full accountability for misdeeds they have\\nperpetrated under the guise of government \"policy.\" Thus, a recent\\ndecision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals -- ruling that a group\\nof government bureaucrats may be held personally liable for\\noutrageous constitutional violations -- is news worthy of celebration.\\n\\nThe facts of the case attest to the need for strong checks on\\ngovernment power. Three Berkeley, Calif., residents had campaigned\\nagainst a proposed homeless shelter in their neighborhood. At the\\nbehest of local \"housing rights\" activists, who said the anti-shelter\\ncampaign was discriminatory and violated the Fair Housing Act, the\\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) got into the\\nact. HUD officials demanded interviews with the three anti-shelter\\nneighbors, told their neighbors they had violated the law, and\\nordered them to give HUD all materials -- including the names,\\naddresses and phone numbers of other opponents of the shelter -- that\\nthey had collected for their campaign. To the \"Berkeley Three,\" HUD\\'s\\nharassment violated their freedom of speech. To the appeals court,\\n\"qualified immunity\" of government bureaucrats did not apply here;\\nthe Berkeley Three may proceed with their First Amendment lawsuit\\nagainst the HUD officials and seek monetary damages.\\n\\nThis ruling, although unusual by today\\'s standards, harks back to\\nanother early legal tradition: the idea that citizens can hold\\ngovernment officials personally liable for improper conduct. In 1763,\\nJohn Wilkes, a member of Britain\\'s parliament, was the subject of an\\noutrageous search and seizure warrant issued by Secretary of State\\nLord Halifax, after Wilkes published an anonymous attack on the\\ngovernment. Wilkes then sued Halifax and other officials and was\\nawarded a sum comparable to $20 million today. Americans were so\\nenraptured with this refutation of unrestrained government power that\\nthey made Wilkes a hero and followed in his footsteps, suing\\ngovernment officials for unreasonable search and seizures.\\n\\nSince the 19th century, however, this common-law tradition has nearly\\nwithered away. The creation of the exclusionary rule has replaced\\nWilkes\\'s remedy with an inferior one. While the exclusionary rule\\nbrings some satisfaction to criminals who are the subject of\\nunreasonable searches and seizures, it does nothing for the innocent.\\nFurthermore, the 20th century has seen the rise of the doctrine of\\n\"qualified immunity,\" which the U.S. Supreme Court explains \"seeks to\\nensure that [government] defendants \\'reasonably can anticipate when\\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability,\\' by attaching liability\\nonly if \\'[t]he contours of the right [violated are] sufficiently\\nclear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is\\ndoing violates that right.\\'\"\\n\\nThe Ninth Circuit\\'s recent ruling that HUD officials were not acting\\nreasonably when they violated the First Amendment rights of the\\nBerkeley Three is refreshing because it rekindles the idea that civil\\nliability can be a restraint on government power. In an era when\\nbureaucratic violations of the rule of law have become routine, it is\\nan idea long overdue.\\n\\nFor the Ninth Circuit\\'s opinion, see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-39-1.html.\\nFor a press release by supporters of the Berkeley Three, the Center\\nfor Individual Rights, see \"HUD Officials Declared Personally\\nLiable...\" at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-39-2.html.\\n\\nFor more information on bureaucratic accountability, see the\\nIndependent Institute book CUTTING GREEN TAPE: Toxic Pollutants,\\nEnvironmental Regulation and the Law, edited by Richard Stroup and\\nRoger Meiners, at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-39-3.html.\\n\\nFor accountability in law enforcement, see the Independent Institute\\nbook TO SERVE AND PROTECT: Privatization and Community in Criminal\\nJustice, by Bruce Benson, at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-39-4.html.\\n\\nFor information on lack of bureaucratic accountability and other\\ncauses of government failure, see the Independent Institute book\\nBEYOND POLITICS: Markets, Welfare, and the Failure of Bureaucracy, by\\nWilliam C.

And yet, Americans today live longer than ever! Are\\nmarkets and private decision-making providing the answers? Or are\\nthese dangers real, immediate, and a legitimate mandate for\\ngovernment control? Can we reduce or eliminate health risks without\\ngovernment dictates? How does politics distort perceptions about\\npublic health?

The extension will allow the company more time to\\nevaluate the bids\\nAbout six companies/groups are understood to be bidding for the three\\ncontracts which are estimated to be worth $220-250m each. They include CCC;\\na consortium of Bonatti, with Entrepose and Dragados & Construcciones and\\nBechtel. The first two contracts involve the construction of the pipelines\\nwith a third contract for six pumping stations. The recent political changes\\nin Algeria, combined with internal administrative changes in Sonatrach, are\\nsaid to have contributed to the delay.\\n\\n\\nOIL PRICES RISE OVER ISRAELI CONFLICT\\nLondon - Oil prices soared on global markets last night following rising\\ntensions in the Middle East.\\nLondon Brent blend futures rose 72 cents to $31.48 but remains short of a\\n10-year high $34.98 touched last month. US light crude was up 92 cents at\\n$32.79 helped by speculators returning to buy oil after a two-week sell-off.\\nFollowing Saudi Arabia\\'s warning that Riyadh and other Arab states would not\\n\"watch with their hands tied\" if Israel attacked Lebanon or Syria, the cost\\nof a barrel of crude went up almost a dollar to $32.79 (o22.60) in New York.\\nEarlier the International Energy Agency set alarm bells ringing when it said\\nthe West was heading into winter with inventories well below the seasonal\\nnorm.\\nOil prices have retreated from their 10-year peaks last month after pressure\\nfrom the G7 industrial nations on producers to pump more crude and the US\\ndecision to release 30m barrels from its strategic reserve. After briefly\\ndipping below $30, prices have risen amid concerns that demand will exceed\\nsupply in the coming months, particularly if the violence in Israel leads to\\na broader conflict. Oil prices are seen as a threat to the prospects of low\\ninflation in the West, and yesterday\\'s increases spilled over into bond\\nmarkets, where worries about Wall Street and energy shortages had already\\ndriven yields higher.\\nA wave of violence between Palestinians and Israelis over the past 12 days\\nhas killed at least 90 people, mostly Palestinians.\\n\\n\\nBUY-BACK TERMS SET TO CHANGE\\nTehran - In an interview with Petroleum Argus this month, Mehdi Hosseini,\\nformer Deputy Oil Minister for international Affairs and now Managing\\nDirector at Kala, the procurement arm of NIOC based in London, indicated\\nthat future negotiations with foreign oil companies will take place using\\nmore favourable terms.\\nNIOC is reportedly close to implementing a more attractive buy-back formula.\\nSince the Islamic Republic re-opened its doors to foreign oil companies in\\n1997, executives had quietly bemoaned the buy-back formula as offering small\\ncapital returns on huge investments. Despite this, Iran\\'s energy buy-back\\nprojects have so far attracted close to $10bn capital to the Iranian energy\\nsector. NIOC argues that it is their duty to negotiate terms favourable to\\nits population rather than to foreign entities. It now appears that in the\\nface of increased competition for foreign investment from its Gulf\\nneighbours, NIOC is prepared to compromise.

I\\'ll send that along as soon\\nas it\\'s ready.\\n\\nAfter you and your associates read it, I think you\\'ll discover that we\\nprovide a VPN tool that eases provisioning of Nortel Contivity, Cisco IOS,\\nAltiga and PIX, as well as VPN management and security policy auditing.

We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable\\nsoftware to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:\\n\\n1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of\\nVPNs.\\n2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote\\nAccess/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies\\nfrom Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.\\n3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based\\nGUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific\\ninterfaces.\\n4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via\\nadvanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service\\nmonitoring.\\n\\nWe would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how\\nyou would like to proceed.

(EOGIL), our subsidiary that owns \\na 30% interest in the Panna, Mukta and Tapti concession areas.    We now have \\nbankers involved and a data room is being prepared in Houston which  made it \\nextremely difficult to keep the deal quiet any longer.  There were numerous \\nrumors circulating through the office, but the reality of the announcement \\nwas still a shock to most of the employees in India and Houston. Basically we \\nsaid the following:\\n 1) Selling assets or companies is a routine part of Enron's strategy to \\nredeploy capital in the higher return opportunities.  The company has \\nexposure to a number of tremendous opportunities today that were not \\nenvisioned even twelve months ago.  In line with this strategy, we are \\nplacing EOGIL in the market.\\n 2) Depending on the success of finding an acceptable buyer for EOGIL,  we \\nwill be reviewing the balance of our portfolio for transfer to other Enron \\nentities or for sale as separate packages.  We anticipate closing the EOGIL \\ntransaction and rationalizing the remaining portfolio by March 31, 2001.  \\n 3) Pending the success outlined in item #2, we will eliminate Enron Global \\nE&P as an Enron business unit on March 31, 2001.\\n 4) We announced some interim staff changes to facilitate the process. \\n  a) Jeff Sherrick would re-focus his time largely on the sale process\\n  b) Mike Stewart will be responsible for all India activity except the sale \\nprocess\\n  c) Steve Harper will be responsible for EGEP's sale activity and \\ncoordination with our bankers and Corporate Development\\n 5) Commented on the potential impact to employees in general terms.  We told \\nthem it was pre-mature to outline all of the possibilities until we signed a \\nPSA with a buyer.  However, in general, there is a good likelihood that many \\npeople will either have opportunities for future employment with the buyers \\nor through redeployment within Enron.  Those people that do not remain with \\nthe assets or are not redeployed in Enron will be involuntarily terminated \\nMarch 31, 2001 unless they are needed to close a transaction or to provide \\ntransition services to a buyer.\\n \\nI would like to keep this as low-keyed as possible.  Last year when we were \\nfor sale there were not a lot of comments, but you never know.  If anyone in \\nthe media picks up on this I would expect it to happen early next week.  Mike \\nStewart is currently in India in the Mumbai office (01191228395841) and can \\nbe reached at the Mariott after-hours(01191228577878).  He is fully briefed \\non our position regarding the activities within EGEP and EOGIL.  Mike will be \\ntraveling offshore and to Baroda over the weekend and on Monday.

       " 'From:  Pete\\n\\nTo:  Ken\\n\\nDate: Friday, October 13, 2000\\n\\n\\nTHE HILL REPORT\\nA Weekly Newsletter from Congressman Pete Sessions\\nWeek of October 7 - October 13, 2000\\n\\nThis Week in Washington, we witnessed a horrific tragedy in the Middle\\nEast. This week\\'s situation has escalated into a sad reminder of\\nthe sacrifice our men and women in uniform make when they report\\nto duty each day in service to our country. Our thoughts, prayers\\nand support go out to their families and to all American military\\nmen and women serving our nation all over the world.\\n\\nThis is also a reminder that though we are living in an era of relative\\npeace and prosperity, America has enemies. There is unrest in the\\nworld and we must be prepared to do everything in our power to find\\nthe people responsible for this heinous act and bring them to justice\\nswiftly. The world\\'s brokers of terror will know there are consequences\\nwhen America is the target of their hate. We are a peace and freedom\\nloving people and these actions will not be tolerated against our\\nsoldiers or our citizens.\\n\\nIn the United States House of Representatives we passed both the\\nDefense Authorization Bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill\\nfor fiscal year 2001.\\n\\nThe Defense Authorization Act, (H.R. 4205) passed by a vote of 382-31\\nand authorizes $309.9 billion in new budget authority for national\\ndefense activities in FY 2001.  In honoring our commitment to our\\nmen and women in service, this amount is $4.6 billion more than the\\nClinton-Gore Administration\\'s request.\\n\\nOverall, the conference report authorizes (1) $75.8 billion for military\\npersonnel; (2) $110.0 billion for operations and maintenance and\\nworking capital funds, (3) $62.9 billion ($2.6 billion more than\\nthe president\\'s request) for weapons procurement, (4) $38.9 billion\\n($1.1 billion more than the president\\'s request) for research and\\ndevelopment, (5) $8.8 billion ($788 million more than the president\\'s\\nrequest) for military construction and family housing.\\n\\nI strongly supported the measure and voted for it.  The bill also\\nprovides a much needed and much deserved 3.7 percent military pay\\nraise and numerous bonuses and other retention and quality of life\\nprograms.\\n\\nThe Agricultural Appropriations bill that also passed this week will\\nhelp farmers and producers of livestock and dairy who are suffering\\nanother year of weather and financial losses, including an additional\\nprovision that lifts limits to $150,000 this crop year on Loan Deficiency\\nPayments (LDPs) and provides the first move to re-opening for agricultural\\ntrade into Cuba.\\n\\nOn Thursday, by a vote of 340 to 75, the House approved H.R. 4461,\\nthe Agricultural Appropriations Act, with the Senate expected to\\nfollow within the week.\\n\\nProducers suffering a series of harvest losses due to weather extremes\\nwill be able to draw upon funding that provides as much help as possible,\\nby providing upwards of $1.6 billion for crops - beyond USDA\\'s recent\\n$1.3 billion estimate.\\n\\nA prescription drug importation measure was also included in the\\nbill and will become law as part of the Agriculture Appropriations\\nAct for Fiscal Year 2001. I hailed the measure as a victory for seniors.\\n\\nThis is great news for America\\'s seniors.  I have always said that\\nthe world\\'s best consumers should not be paying the world\\'s highest\\nprices. This week we passed a bill to change that.\\n\\nCurrently, seniors in Texas and across the country are paying as\\nmuch as 70% more for prescription drugs than their counterparts in\\nother countries. For example, in 1998, a 30-day supply of \"Prilosec\"\\ncost about $99.95 in Texas but that same 30-day supply was a mere\\n$17.50 in Mexico.\\n\\nI strongly support giving seniors more choices in their health care\\noptions but warned that increased choices means increased responsibility.\\n Millions of seniors wanted to be able to buy prescription drugs\\nfrom Canada and Mexico in order to save money on some drugs.  This\\nbill does that for them but seniors must be aware of the safety concerns\\nassociated with getting drugs from other countries.\\n\\nAround Texas...\\n\\nTomorrow, I will hold a town hall meeting in Mexia,  and following\\nthe town hall meeting there will be a \"Cancer Society Walk for Life\".\\n And next week, I will be in Bryan for a Town Hall Meeting.  See\\nthe notices at the end of this e-mail.\\n\\nHave a great weekend! - Pete\\n\\n\\n\\n>>>  Town Hall Meeting <<<\\nLimestone County Town Hall Meeting on Saturday, October 14\\nWHEN:  1:00 pm - 2:30 pm\\nWHERE: TXU Electric\\n       211 North Sherman St\\n       Mexia, Texas\\n\\n\\n>>>  Town Hall Meeting <<<\\nBrazos and Robertson County Town Hall Meeting on Saturday, October\\n21\\nWHEN:  2:00 pm - 3:30 pm\\nWHERE: GTE Building\\n       501 Industrial Blvd\\n       Bryan, Texas\\n\\n\\nHave an old cell phone?

The focus of the event was the launching of the =01&Just Ask=01=\\n8\\ncampaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consume=\\nr\\nawareness about food from the ocean.

Many seafoods commonly available today are much\\nless plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the\\ngreatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and\\nretailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue\\nwill have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.\\n\\nAmerica=01,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in\\nattendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,\\nKingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert\\nKinkead, Kinkead=01,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,\\nPhiladelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to\\nDungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with\\nseaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in a=\\nn\\nirresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their\\nrecipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.\\n\\nOther notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The\\nEnvironment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;\\nMindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart\\nMagazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior\\nEditor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of\\nthe Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.\\n\\nThe evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new =01&Jus=\\nt\\nAsk=018 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and=\\n all\\nof its fundamental projects continues to grow.

       " 'Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern \\nGas Pipeline Route.  Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain \\nstrategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of \\nthis proposal.  To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory \\npipe, ENA\\'s opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis \\nmarkets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward \\ncharacteristics. Other than understanding the potential flows and costs, \\nthere is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA \\npoint of view.\\n\\nThe ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.  \\nThe US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.  \\nthe remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, \\nventure capital and the \"organizing group\" (40%!!).  Stan Horton, if he \\nbelieves this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million \\nof founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to \\nparticipate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.  \\n\\nRegards\\nDelainey',\n",

He has infinite\\ntime for them, as he always has for my  \\nsister and me.? He is never rushed,\\nnever hurried.? He is supremely  \\nkind, loving and patient - listening to\\ntheir latest song from school,  \\nreading bedtime stories, or teaching them how\\nto fish (a lesson Cheneys learn  \\nearly). \\nHe grew up in Casper, Wyoming in the days when you could ride your  \\nbike out\\nof town and hunt rabbits on the prairie.? His dad, a World War  \\nII veteran,\\nwas a career civil servant with the Soil Conservation  \\nService.? His mom\\nworked as a secretary at Bustard\\'s Funeral Home to  \\nmake ends meet.? He\\npitched for the local American Legion baseball  \\nteam.? He owed much of his\\nskill to my grandmother, who had played for  \\nthe Syracuse, Nebraska\\nBluebirds, a nationally-ranked girls\\' softball  \\nteam.? She caught his pitches\\nmany evenings on their front lawn at 505  \\nTexas Place.\\nHe was the first in his family to graduate from college.?  \\nHe built\\npowerlines across Wyoming and Colorado to help pay his way.? He  \\ncarried a\\nticket for six years in the International Brotherhood of Electrical  \\nWorkers.\\n\\nHe married his high school sweetheart, Lynne, in  \\n1964.?? One look at the\\ninscriptions they penned in each other\\'s  \\nhigh school yearbooks and you know\\nthey were as deeply in love at 18 as they  \\nare today.? He was the captain of\\nthe football team and she was the  \\nhomecoming queen.? Getting her elected was\\nhis first political  \\ncampaign.\\nThere have been lots of other campaigns since then.? Despite  \\nhis success,\\nhe\\'s not a typical politician.? He\\'s not a  \\nglad-hander.? He\\'s not a\\nfast-talker.? He\\'s not slick.? He is  \\nwho he is.? He is real and honest and\\ntrue.? \\nHe loves this  \\ncountry.? He knows how blessed we all are to be Americans.?  \\nHe\\ntaught my sister and me that we owe everything we have to the brave men  \\nand\\nwomen who died so that we could be free.? When we were young, he  \\ntook us to\\nthe battlefields where the Civil War was fought.? He taught  \\nus to love\\nhistory and to revere this great nation.???  \\nServing as Secretary of Defense was the greatest honor of his life.? I  \\nhave\\nheard him say that this was because of the troops, the men and women of  \\nthe\\nU.S. military.?

       " 'S m o k e   a n d   S m e a r s\\nChristopher DeMuth and Steven Hayward\\nOctober 17, 2000\\n\\n In the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, Vice President Gore is=\\n=20\\nreturning to the theme that Governor Bush=02=07s Texas has become an abysma=\\nl place=20\\nto live. It is a hard case to make=02=05Texas is today the fifth fastest gr=\\nowing=20\\nstate and fifth in net influx of Americans from other states, and Mr. Bush =\\nis=20\\none of the nation=02=07s most popular governors.\\n Mr. Gore=02=07s earlier attacks on the governor=02=07s education record we=\\nre set aside=20\\nfollowing the July release of a comprehensive RAND study showing that Texas=\\n=20\\nhas become the nation=02=07s top state in achievement test scores. His subs=\\nequent=20\\nassertions about the number of Texans lacking health insurance seem to have=\\n=20\\nfizzled as well (it turns out that the number of uninsured has been falling=\\n=20\\nin Texas while rising in the nation as a whole). That leaves environmental=\\n=20\\nquality, where the Vice President and his ad writers have leveled a fusilla=\\nde=20\\nof dramatic allegations about increasing pollution in Texas=02=07s cities a=\\nnd=20\\nstreams.\\n Environmental quality presents rich opportunities for misleading data and=\\n=20\\nrhetoric. Measuring air and water pollution involves a host of variables: o=\\nne=20\\ncan measure pollution by emissions or by the quality of the air and water,=\\n=20\\nand measurements of air and water quality depend on the placement of=20\\nmonitors, the use of *peak* versus average levels, and adjustments for=20\\npopulation exposure and for the widely differing health and amenity effects=\\n=20\\nof different kinds of pollution. Rankings among states are much more=20\\nproblematic than rankings of school performance or health care, because all=\\n=20\\nstates that are more urbanized and industrialized have higher pollution=20\\nlevels. Texas accounts for 60 percent of the nation=02=07s petrochemical=20\\nproduction capacity and 25 percent of oil refining, and it is the only stat=\\ne=20\\nwith two metropolitan areas (Houston and Dallas-Ft. Worth) among the nation=\\n=02=07s=20\\ntop ten. Measured by simple gross quantities, Texas, California, and New=20\\nJersey will have *more pollution* than most other states under any=20\\ncircumstances; the rest of us can enjoy the products without having to both=\\ner=20\\nso much with the pollution-control challenges.\\n Mr. Gore=02=07s charges exploit these opportunities to the hilt, combining=\\n=20\\nmisleading statistics with a few outright fabrications to create an=20\\nimpression that bears little relationship to reality. The charges are,=20\\nhowever, easy to debunk, and it is surprising that they been reported with=\\n=20\\nlittle scrutiny by a media that has otherwise grown wary of the Vice=20\\nPresident=02=07s loose ways with facts.\\n The Gore campaign=02=07s favorite charge is that Houston has passed Los An=\\ngeles=20\\nto become *the smog capital of the United States,* *No. 1 in air pollution,=\\n*=20\\nand *the dirtiest city in the nation.* (We will ignore Democratic National=\\n=20\\nCommittee Chairman Joe Andrew=02=07s claim that Houston has become *the dir=\\ntiest=20\\ncity in the world,* which was evidently uttered in a fit of enthusiasm for=\\n=20\\nthe latest party line.) The charge is false. According to the U.S.=20\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, air quality in Houston is improving and is=\\n=20\\nunambiguously better than in Los Angeles, and is also better than in many=\\n=20\\nother cities.\\n The Houston charge is based on 1999 city data on ambient levels of ozone=\\n=02=05one=20\\nof six *criteria* air pollutants regulated under the national Clean Air Act=\\n=02=05\\nas measured by numbers of days of *exceedences*of the EPA=02=07s national=\\n=20\\nstandard. Ozone levels are highly sensitive to weather conditions, especial=\\nly=20\\ntemperature. They have been essentially flat in Houston in recent years (an=\\nd=20\\nother southern cities such as Atlanta), but they fell sharply in Los Angele=\\ns=20\\nin 1999 due to unusually cool summer weather. As a result, Houston topped L=\\nos=20\\nAngeles (and all other cities) in ozone exceedences=02=05but its air qualit=\\ny was=20\\nnevertheless better than LA=02=07s. Houston=02=07s ozone level was 10 perce=\\nnt higher=20\\nthan in Los Angeles, but its particulates level was 20 percent lower=20\\n(particulates are the other major component of *smog,* and according to the=\\n=20\\nEPA a far more serious health risk than ozone; there is no separate measure=\\n=20\\nof *smog*). Houston did vastly better than LA for three of the four other=\\n=20\\nClean Air Act pollutants: 63% lower for nitrogen oxides, 64% lower for carb=\\non=20\\nmonoxide, and 78% lower for lead (the cities=02=07 sulphur dioxide levels w=\\nere=20\\nidentical). While Houston was out of compliance with EPA=02=07s national st=\\nandard=20\\nfor only one pollutant, ozone, LA was out of compliance for three: ozone,=\\n=20\\nparticulates, and carbon monoxide.\\n We hasten to add that we are comparing Houston with Los Angeles only to=20\\ndemonstrate the falsity of Mr. Gore=02=07s allegation. If Houston is not nu=\\nmber=20\\none in air pollution, neither is it number two or even number six (Houston =\\nis=20\\nthe nation=02=07s sixth largest metropolitan area).  According to the EPA A=\\nir=20\\nQuality Index, which aggregates levels of all six air pollutants and weight=\\ns=20\\nthem according to the health risks of each, air quality in Houston is bette=\\nr=20\\nthan in ten other metropolitan areas. Houston also bests ten other cities o=\\nn=20\\na separate EPA index of ozone alone. (These data are for 1998, the most=20\\nrecent year available; rankings for 1999 and 2000 will probably be similar.=\\n)\\n A related charge, and particularly egregious falsehood, is Vice President=\\n=20\\nGore=02=07s assertion that Governor Bush *made key air pollution rules in T=\\nexas=20\\nvoluntary.* In 1999, Governor Bush signed two laws concerned with=20\\n*grandfathered* sources of air pollution. Under the Clean Air Act and almos=\\nt=20\\nall state air pollution programs, old power plants and industrial facilitie=\\ns=20\\nare subject to much more lenient emissions standards than new ones. It is a=\\n=20\\nserious loophole that has been bad for the economy as well as the environme=\\nnt=02=05\\ninducing firms to maintain old facilities (both less efficient and more=20\\npolluting than new ones) for longer then they otherwise would, and leading =\\nto=20\\nprotracted litigation over the difference between renovating an old facilit=\\ny=20\\nand building a new one. Under the 1999 legislation, Texas became one of the=\\n=20\\nfirst three states to begin closing the loophole through tighter standards=\\n=20\\nfor old facilities. The step was praised by environmental groups and helped=\\n=20\\ncoax Mr. Gore, who had not previously confronted the problem as a legislato=\\nr=20\\nor Vice President, to propose a national program of his own for old power=\\n=20\\nplants. (Mr. Bush has also advanced a national proposal.)\\n But there was a wrinkle in the Texas initiative: the law covering utilitie=\\ns=20\\nenacted mandatory standards (which will result in huge reductions in power=\\n=20\\nplant emissions over the next three years), but the law covering industrial=\\n=20\\nfacilities enacted a *voluntary* compliance schedule coupled with increased=\\n=20\\nfees for noncompliance. There is legitimate disagreement over just how=20\\neffective the fee-incentive program will turn out to be; there have been so=\\nme=20\\ninitial reductions in the first year, apparently of about 25,000 tons of ai=\\nr=20\\npollution, but the program is too recent to estimate likely future=20\\nreductions. What is not in dispute is that both the *mandatory* and=20\\n*voluntary* prongs of the Texas program constitute an extension and=20\\ntightening of air pollution controls=02=05and an innovation that powerful b=\\nusiness=20\\nopposition has thwarted at the national level and in most states. Nor is it=\\n=20\\ndisputed that the use of economic incentives rather than regulatory mandate=\\ns=20\\nmay significantly improve the effectiveness of our environmental laws and a=\\nre=20\\nworth a try; indeed, that is precisely the approach of the Vice President=\\n=02=07s=20\\nnational proposal for old utilities, which consists not of mandatory=20\\nstandards but *voluntary* tax incentives.\\n For Mr. Gore=02=05a self-described environmentalist and reformer=02=05now =\\nto turn on=20\\nthe Texas reforms and describe them as having weakened existing pollution=\\n=20\\nstandards (*Bush made key air pollution rules voluntary*) is an act of=20\\nstriking mendacity. His latest campaign ad adds a particularly ruthless=20\\ntwist: it couples the *made voluntary* fabrication with the Houston air=20\\nquality fabrication to produce a triple falsehood=02=05that air pollution g=\\not=20\\nworse in Houston because Governor Bush weakened air pollution standards.\\n The Vice President=02=07s most plenary change is that, under Governor Bush=\\n, Texas=20\\nhas become *last among all states in air quality,* *No. 1 in industrial air=\\n=20\\npollution,* and *No. 3 in water pollution.* Although the Gore campaign has=\\n=20\\noccasionally relied on newspaper articles and rankings produced by=20\\nenvironmental groups, its primary and only official source for these claims=\\n=20\\nis an EPA compilation called the Toxics Release Inventory. The TRI, however=\\n,=20\\nis not a useful measure of air or water pollution and is not a measure of=\\n=20\\nenvironmental quality at all. Instead, it measures *releases* of certain=20\\nsubstances that the EPA classifies as toxic=02=05and *releases* includes no=\\nt only=20\\nthose that pollute the air and water but also those that are properly=20\\ndisposed of through EPA-approved hazardous waste management and water=20\\ntreatment practices. The agency=02=07s annual TRI reports warn that its est=\\nimates=20\\n*reflect releases and other waste management activities of chemicals, not=\\n=20\\nexposures of the public to those chemicals,* and that they are not sufficie=\\nnt=20\\nto determine exposure or harm to the environment or public health.\\n So the TRI numbers cannot possibly support Mr. Gore=02=07s assertions. But=\\n even=20\\nin their own terms, they tell a story that is the opposite of what the Vice=\\n=20\\nPresident would like voters to believe. Texas has always been near the top =\\nof=20\\nthe various TRI ratings, reflecting the state=02=07s huge share of national=\\n=20\\npetrochemical and refining capacity. But it did not become No. 1 in the=20\\noverall ranking under Governor Bush, as the Gore campaign insinuates. Rathe=\\nr,=20\\nTexas was No. 1 under Mr. Bush=02=07s predecessor, Democratic Governor Ann=\\n=20\\nRichards, and it has improved significantly since he took office. The EPA=\\n=02=07s=20\\n1999 release of TRI data through 1997 noted that *Texas, the state with the=\\n=20\\nlargest production-related waste managed in 1997, was also the state=20\\nprojecting the largest absolute reduction . . . over the next two years.* T=\\nhe=20\\ndata for 1998, released earlier this year, shows Texas leading the nation i=\\nn=20\\nreduction of toxic releases=02=05with 43 million pounds eliminated between =\\n1995=20\\n(the first year of Mr. Bush=02=07s governorship) and 1998. The new report a=\\nlso=20\\nfinds Texas leading all other states in energy recovery and waste treatment=\\n,=20\\nand second in on-site recycling. Due in part to these improvements, Texas h=\\nas=20\\nnow dropped from first to fifth place in the TRI composite index.\\n Environmental quality in Texas has improved under Governor Bush according =\\nto=20\\nvirtually every useful measure. Here are a few selected statistics of our=\\n=20\\nown: According to the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission,=20\\nindustrial air emissions in Texas fell 11% from 1994 through 1998. Accordin=\\ng=20\\nto the EPA, ambient air quality in Texas improved for five of the six=20\\nnational air pollutants for the same period, all Texas cities but one now=\\n=20\\nmeet the national standards for four or more of the six pollutants (the=20\\nexception, El Paso, due to cross-border pollution from Mexico), and half of=\\n=20\\nTexas=02=07s cities are now below the national average for all six pollutan=\\nts.=20\\nAccording to the EPA, Texas=02=07s proportion of rivers and streams classif=\\nied as=20\\n*impaired* is better than the national average. And according to=20\\nEnvironmental Defense, which prepares a comprehensive index of water qualit=\\ny=20\\naggregating 15 Clean Water Act pollution measures, Texas is not *No. 3 in=\\n=20\\nwater pollution* but No. 37=02=05its overall water quality is better than i=\\nn 36=20\\nother states.\\n Governor Bush does not get all of the credit for this record; it is also d=\\nue=20\\nto the progressive tightening of national environmental standards and,=20\\nperhaps even more, to progressive improvements in production technologies.=\\n=20\\nBut he gets a share of it, due to his own decisions and those of his=20\\nappointees.  And in several critical areas of environmental policy, he has=\\n=20\\nbeen a national leader=02=05closing the old plants loophole, redeveloping=\\n=20\\n*brownfields* laid waste by the perverse incentives of the Superfund progra=\\nm,=20\\nproviding positive incentives to businesses for *pollution prevention* and =\\nto=20\\nprivate landowners for conservation and species protection, and improving t=\\nhe=20\\nfinancing of public parks and recreation areas. *Texas-style environmental=\\n=20\\nregulation,* which the Gore campaign invites us to fear, is, like Texas-sty=\\nle=20\\nschool reform, something Americans can look forward to.\\n_____________________\\nMr. DeMuth is president of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington,=\\n=20\\nD.C. and Mr. Hayward is a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute i=\\nn=20\\nSan Francisco.

The two\\nfocused on the City\\'s ongoing efforts to preserve and create more affordable\\nhousing, the current tools available to continue enforcing anti-camping\\nlaws, and announced an expanded partnership with JOIN -- a private\\norganization that does outreach to homeless people.\\n\\n\"While I am still a firm believer in the need for the anti-camping ordinance\\nto prevent unsafe and unsanitary campgrounds, this has given us the\\nopportunity to take a closer look at what we in the City are doing to\\nprovide housing and shelter opportunities for everyone,\" said Katz, \"and\\nwhile we\\'ve made strides meeting our affordable housing commitments, there\\nis still more we can do.\"\\n\\nKatz and Commissioner Erik Sten announced their intent to follow the\\nrecommendation of Sten\\'s 0-30% Housing Resources Task Force to spend $3.5\\nmillion of the $5 million allocated for affordable housing this coming year\\non housing for those in the 0-30 percent median income range.  Over the last\\nseven years, the City of Portland has committed nearly $270 million towards\\naffordable housing, in addition to foregoing $10.5 million in revenue\\nthrough tax abatements.\\n\\n\"Homelessness is an issue that should be addressed by first dealing with the\\nindividual at a personal level,\" said Commissioner Sten.  \"I appreciate that\\nthe City is continuing to move forward on doing this with aggressive efforts\\naround things such as housing and outreach services.\"\\n\\nKatz and Sten also noted recent successes in meeting affordable housing\\nneeds, including the Portland Development Commission\\'s just-completed\\npurchase of the Fountain Place apartment building and the recent opening of\\nRitzdorf Court which completed the Shelter Reconfiguration Plan.  The\\nFountain Place acquisition -- completed just last Friday, means the city\\nwill save the building\\'s affordable housing rates, and serve as potential\\nreplacement housing for nearby low-income units soon to be lost.\\n\\nAdditionally, Katz and Sten also announced an expanded partnership with JOIN\\n-- an outreach group that works to connect the homeless with services.\\n\\nThe Bureau of Housing and Community Development plans to increase JOIN\\'s\\ncurrent contract with the bureau to a total of $90,000.  This money,\\ncombined with a new $80,000 contribution from the Portland Police Bureau,\\nwill increase the number of JOIN outreach workers, enabling them to work in\\nevery precinct to link homeless people with housing assistance resources.\\n\\n\"It is critical that we find ways for all of us to work together to help\\nhomeless people find their way off the streets -- that means our outreach\\nworkers, police, ODOT, and neighbors all collaborating to make that happen,\"\\nsaid Rob Justus, Executive Director, JOIN.  \"Our ultimate goal is to respond\\nto homelessness and address the negative effect of hundreds on the streets\\nby helping people into housing.  By engaging the homeless people where they\\nare -- whether it\\'s under a bridge or in an alleyway -- our outreach workers\\ncan help them begin that transition off the streets.\"\\n\\nAt the same time, Katz and Sten said that the City\\'s aggressive efforts to\\npreserve and create affordable housing opportunities and to link homeless\\nindividuals to those opportunities, made it all the more reasonable to\\ncontinue to enforce the City\\'s anti-camping policy which prevents unsafe and\\nunhealthy campsites from degrading neighborhood livability.  Both said they\\nare pleased the Multnomah County District Attorney has decided to appeal\\nJudge Stephen Gallagher\\'s opinion that the City\\'s Homeless Camping Ordinance\\nis unconstitutional.\\n\\nWhile the City Attorney\\'s Office and DA\\'s Office continue to analyze the\\nimplications of the Gallagher opinion, Portland Police Bureau Assistant\\nChief Bruce Prunk outlined alternative tools the City intends to use to\\ncontinue its efforts to restrict homeless camping in public areas.\\n\\n1. Parks -- City Code closes most City parks between midnight and 5\\na.m., others, such as Forest Park, close earlier.  After closure, people\\ncamping would be subject to state law prohibition on criminal trespass in\\nthe second degree, and police could issue citations and/or remove people for\\ntrespassing.  The City also has the ability to exclude people from City\\nparks for a period of not more than 30 days.  Permanent or temporary\\nstructures or facilities are also prohibited by City Code at all times, so\\npolice could issue citations or remove people violating the ordinance as an\\nunclassified misdemeanor.\\n\\n2. Highway Overpasses -- Oregon Department of Transportation property\\nunder I-5 and I-405 overpasses are posted with \"No Trespassing\" signs, which\\nmeans police could issue citations to anyone camping at those locations.\\n\\n3. Sidewalks -- There are provisions of the City Code that prohibit\\nsidewalk obstructions.\\n\\n4. Parking -- City Code prohibits parking a recreational vehicle in the\\npublic right of way directly across from a residential, public park, church\\nor school property unless the vehicle is being loaded and unloaded for a\\nperiod not to exceed eight hours.  In addition, no vehicle may park on the\\npublic right of way or other public property in excess of 24 hours without\\nCity permission.  If so, the vehicle may be removed.\\n\\nPrunk said the Police Bureau would continue to work with the partners\\ncurrently in place, such as JOIN, noting that recent efforts have focused\\nless on anti-camping citations, and more on trespassing violations.\\n\\n\\nTo read Mayor Katz\\'s comments from the news conference, go to\\nhttp://www.ci.portland.or.us/mayor/speeches/2/homelessaffordablespc.htm\\n\\nTo read The Oregonian\\'s editorial on this subject, see the following link\\nhttp://www.oregonlive.com/oped/index.ssf?/oped/00/10/ed_11ldh1001.frame\\n\\n* * * * * * * *\\n\\nDEADLINE EXTENDED FOR PORTLAND UTILITIES REVIEW BOARD (PURB) BUSINESS,\\nNEIGHBORHOOD REPRESENTATIVES\\n\\n\\nBecause of multiple vacancies, the City of Portland\\'s Portland Utilities\\nReview Board (PURB) is still looking for qualified members and has extended\\nits deadline for applications.

We provide you with updates of the\\nInstitute\\'s current research publications, events and media programs.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIN THIS WEEK\\'S ISSUE:\\n1. Defective Tires, Defective Bureaucracy\\n2. Paul Craig Roberts on the War on Crime\\n3. Medicare Reform: Economics versus Politics\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDEFECTIVE TIRES, DEFECTIVE BUREAUCRACY\\n\\nSome fans of the regulatory state believe that NHTSA, the National\\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, deserves much credit -- and,\\nin reward, expanded powers -- for its role in exposing the Firestone\\ntire/ Ford Explorer fiasco. But although NHTSA received early reports\\nof fatalities caused by the separation of Firestone tires, its\\ninvestigation began very recently -- last May -- long after\\ninvestigations by State Farm Insurance, the Center for Auto Safety,\\nand Safety Forum brought the problem to light.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the first time that NHTSA has failed its mission, argues\\nMichael I. Krauss, law professor at George Mason University and\\nauthor of the recent Independent Institute book FIRE AND SMOKE:\\nGovernment, Lawsuits and the Rule of Law.\\n\\n\"NHTSA, the agency responsible for minimum fuel economy standards\\n(found by a court to have likely cost many lives by forcing\\nmanufacturers to produce light, dangerous cars) and for\\nillegal-to-disable, baby-killing airbags, does not deserve to be\\nrewarded for its asleep-at-the-switch approach to the tire problem,\"\\nKrauss wrote recently.\\n\\nIt would be absurd to reward Firestone for selling defective tires.\\nHowever, when NHTSA fails, self-proclaimed \"consumer advocates\" call\\nfor a parallel absurdity: lavishing the agency with more regulatory\\nauthority and taxpayer funds. But NHTSA\\'s pattern of failure\\nindicates a systemic problem -- a design flaw -- that cannot be\\neasily repaired. In contrast, as the Firestone episode demonstrates,\\nthe watchful eyes of the American economic and legal systems have\\nenormous incentives to detect and report product defects. In this\\nlight, perhaps what most needs to be recalled and held accountable\\nfor sloppy workmanship and false advertising is: the defective\\nregulatory state.\\n\\nFor more information, see \"The Feds Eye Firestone,\" by Michael Krauss\\n(The Washington Times, 9/22/00), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-1.html.\\n\\nFor Michael Krauss\\'s book, FIRE AND SMOKE: Government, Lawsuits and\\nthe Rule of Law (The Independent Institute, 2000), see\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-2.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPAUL CRAIG ROBERTS ON THE WAR ON CRIME\\n\\nElection-year promises always renew the risk that peaceful Americans\\nwill see their rights sacrificed for the sake of political\\nexpediency. This is especially true when politicians promise to \"get\\ntough on crime,\" as syndicated columnist and Independent Institute\\nresearch fellow Paul Craig Roberts pointed out recently.\\n\\nAlthough one \"anti-crime\" bill (or \"anti-privacy\" according to its\\ncritics) was recently defeated, another \"anti-crime\" bill -- this one\\nstrengthening asset forfeiture laws -- has just been introduced.\\nUnfortunately, says Roberts, asset forfeiture laws violate due\\nprocess and are any easy way for politicians to look \"tough on crime\"\\neven though such laws harm innocent Americans far more than criminals.\\n\\n\"The House Judiciary Committee led by Henry Hyde, R-Ill., has\\ndocumented the most extraordinary abuses of the asset forfeiture\\nlaws,\" writes Roberts. \"The Banking Committee and [the bill\\'s author]\\nshould sit down with Hyde and listen carefully before they create any\\nmore Gestapo powers for law-enforcement officers.\"\\n\\nFor more information, see \"Dangers lurk in war on crime,\" by Paul\\nCraig Roberts, at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-3.html.\\n\\nFor more on civil forfeiture laws, see CIVIL FORFEITURE AS A \"SIN\\nTAX\" by Donald J. Boudreaux and Adam Pritchard, at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-4.html.\\n\\nAlso see the Independent Institute book, TO SERVE AND PROTECT:\\nPrivatization and Community in Criminal Justice, by Bruce Benson, at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-5.html.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nMEDICARE REFORM: Economics versus Politics\\n\\nDebates over Medicare reform didn\\'t start with Al Gore and George W.\\nBush. In fact, legislation similar to Medicare had been intensely\\ndebated since the mid-1940s. However, its advocates found no way to\\novercome opposition until 1965, when Medicare\\'s staunchest advocate\\non the House Ways and Means Committee found the opportunity to\\nsmuggle Medicare legislation into another bill at the last minute.\\n\\nYet as vocal as debates over Medicare have been, very little of that\\ndebate has been informed by sound economic principles. This omission,\\nwhich has stalled any genuine reform of Medicare, is largely the\\nfault of economists, says economist Robert B. Helms in the new issue\\nof THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW.\\n\\n\"My criticism is not directed to the economists who have attempted\\nfor many years to apply market principles to health-care issues, but\\nto the larger number of economists who have not,\" Helms writes.\\n\"Moreover, my criticism pertains to the failure of economists to\\nteach the fundamental principles of economics to educated Americans,\\nrather than to the failure of \\'economics.\\'\"\\n\\nTo improve the quality of the debate over Medicare, Helms recommends\\nthree measures. First, more economists must explain to policymakers\\nand the public that that market competition in health care, as in\\nother markets, would improve quality of health care. Second, they\\nmust explain that competition would also make health care more\\nefficient by allocating scarce resources to higher-valued uses.\\nFinally, they must explain that price controls and destructive of\\nthese desirable ends.\\n\\nWithout a concerted effort to impart these principles to a wider\\naudience, Helms argues, Medicare reform -- and other necessary\\nhealth-policy reforms -- will become victim of political maneuvering,\\nmuch to the detriment of the lives and well-being of the American\\npublic.\\n\\n\"This lack of education in economics is appallingly evident in\\nWashington, D.C., especially on Capitol Hill,\" says Helms.\\n\\nFor more information, see \"Medicare Reform: Economics versus\\nPolitics\" by Richard B. Helms (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Fall 2000), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-6.html.\\n\\nFor more on Medicare, see \"Medicare\\'s Progeny: The 1996 Health Care\\nLegislation\" by Charlotte Twight (THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW, Winter\\n1998), at\\nhttp://www.independent.org/tii/lighthouse/LHLink2-40-7.html.\\n\\nAlso see the Independent Institute book, AMERICAN HEALTH CARE:\\nGovernment, Market Processes and the Public Interest, edited by Roger\\nD.

Four (4) Bcf of incremental \\nsupplies just cannot be directed to a market hub...i.e., Chicago, for \\ninstance.\\n\\nOur goal with El Paso is to develop a joint market assessment of where the \\ndemand for incremental supplies is needed and then develop a total project \\nthat would get the gas to the various markets.\\n\\nOur ownership of NNG, TW and NBPL and El Paso\\'s ownership of ANR, El Paso and \\nTennessee will cover a lot of impacted pipelines.\\n\\nI believe our best bet as of now is not to commit to a specific route or \\nproject (i.e., Hoglund\\'s), but work with the producers on a total delivery \\nsystem...wellhead to city gate/burner tip.\\n\\nYour thoughts would be appreciated before we move too far in this direction.\\n\\nStan\\n\\nP.S.

SOMEWHERE?\\nBy Tim Laseter, Martha Turner, Anne Chung, and Pat Houston\\n\\nNew York, Oct 17, 2000- Last week\\'s announcement that the Web-based e-tailer \\nand delivery service Urbanfetch was discontinuing its business-to-consumer \\noperation came as no surprise to us. As we pointed out in the August issue of \\nstrategy+business, such companies -- highflyers Kozmo.com, Webvan, and \\nHomeGrocer among them -- face limited online sales potential, high cost of \\ndelivery, a speed-variety trade-off, and existing, entrenched competition. \\n\"We believe the last mile may lead to the gallows rather than to the promised \\nland,\" we wrote.\\n\\nSince that article appeared, Webvan acquired HomeGrocer, Kozmo cancelled its \\nplans for an initial public offering, and Urbanfetch closed its core \\nbusiness. Are we gloating over our prescience? Not at all. We think all these \\nmoves are signs of maturity -- and indications that one or more players may \\ndevelop a winning business model.\\n\\n------------------------------\\nTo read the full analysis:\\nhttp://www.strategy-business.com/enews/101700.html\\n-------------------------------\\nS+B\\'s enews is an exclusive platform for e-business analysis, insights, \\ncommentary, and other intellectual capital from the authors, strategists, and \\neditors at strategy+business.\\n\\nRandall Rothenberg\\nEditor-in-Chief\\nstrategy+business\\n------------------------------\\n\\nTo have your address removed from the enews e-mail list, go to:\\n\\nhttp://www.sbsubscriber.com/services/welcome.cfm?ref=newsletter_register.cfm&D\\n=20001019060120&N=5429693.0&R=4428.0&frame=N.\\n',\n",
       " 'You might mark your calendar for a lunch (12-1:30) at the Hyatt downtown on \\nWednesday December 13 where Barton Smith of UH and George Tolley of the U. of \\nChicago will present the findings of their economic study.  The Houston Forum \\nevent will be part of the Kenneth L. Lay Lecture Series in Global Economics \\nat the University of Houston.  (I will have a table for Enron.)\\n\\nThe authors presented their preliminary results to us this week, and the \\ntotal benefits of the planned ozone reduction (all SIP measures as currently \\nproposed) are below $100 million (we are indoors most of the time that bad \\nair days are occurring since it is typically very hot), and the costs are \\naround $5 billion out to 2010.   Lots of caveats to this conclusion including \\nthe assumption of today\\'s best technology but no more.  The high costs \\ninclude a \"last mile\" problem that the proposal of the Partnership\\'s Business \\nCoalition for Clean Air (BCCA) avoids (such as no noon-to-midnight \\nconstruction, a 75% average point source reduction to allow for trading and \\nfuture permits instead of a 90% reduction, etc.).\\n\\nThe effect on Houston is to reduce our forecast economic growth but not \\neliminate it.  Real wages are forecast to fall by some 5% or more under the \\ncurrent SIP versus without it.  Total job loss will be over 100,000--about a \\n1 and a half years of growth out to 2010.   This \"shock\" will be around \\none-half of what Houston went through after the oil price crash in 1986 \\naccording to Dr. Smith.  One might say that slower growth and spreading the \\npollution around (some of our refinery/petrochemical growth going elsewhere) \\nis not the end of the world, however, if a more cost-effective SIP is chosen.\\n\\nIt will be several weeks before the results are final (and the election \\nover), at which time an executive summary will be released.  The Mayor\\'s \\noffice and TNRCC will be briefed first.  The luncheon will be the formal \\nunveiling of the study with explanation, but I expect press coverage of the \\nstudy next month.\\n\\nAs head of the economics working group, I have tried to ensure that a \\ntop-notch analysis was done without an industry bias.  The results are \\nconsidered conservative by the authors all things considered and in line with \\nthe peer-reviewed literature on costs and benefits.  The study is not \\nintended to be a \"whining\" study but to give us realistic expectations and to \\n(naturally) bring into review some \"last mile\" problems where certain SIP \\nmeasures are the least cost effective.\\n\\nThese preliminary results are confidential given the political cycle we are \\nin and should not be shared externally.\\n\\n- Rob',\n",

       " \"Kenneth,\\n\\nKey Customers, Partners, and Suppliers are your company's most valuable\\nstrategic assets\\nas they account either for a majority of the revenues (80/20 rule) or carry\\nsignificant\\ninvestor mindshare.  The problem today is that these crucial relationships\\nare complex to manage, involving multiple people, systems, information, and\\nprocesses that cross company boundaries.  As a result, studies show that\\nsales teams are spending upto half their time managing day-to-day account\\ncoordination - taking valuable time away from selling.\\n\\nThe question is - How can you successfully foster strategic relationships\\nwhile lowering account management costs?\\n\\nOur CEO faced this problem when managing relationships like these for a\\nleading high-tech company.  She realized, in frustration, that there was no\\ninfrastructure to manage strategic relationships consistently and\\nproactively.  There were front-office automation and CRM applications that\\nimproved forecasting, sales support and other internal processes, and there\\nwere personalization applications that pushed information to customers, but\\nthere was no application that provided a comprehensive customer-driven view\\nof strategic relationships.\\n\\nSo, we developed the Kovair VIPCenter -- a relationship-centered application\\nthat crosses company boundaries and consolidates all the touchpoints in a\\nstrategic relationship (people, applications, information, and processes).\\n\\nEach VIPCenter is a bi-directional, relationship-specific Web portal that\\nfosters long-term collaboration and deeper intimacy with each of your\\nstrategic partners, suppliers, and customers throughout the relationship\\ncycle.\\n\\nVIPCenter has a unique extensible application architecture. Out-of-the-box,\\nVIPCenter has\\nall the core applications needed to manage strategic relationships so you\\ncan be up and\\nrunning quickly.  And, it is built on Kovair's patented SRM platform,\\nproviding seamless interoperability with CRM and ERP applications,\\nenterprise-class scalability, and extensibility.\\n\\nSimply put, Kovair's VIPCenter allows you to build more intimate long-term\\nrelationships with these key customers, suppliers and partners, while\\nlowering account management costs.\\n\\nI have attached a Product Data Sheet, Technical Architecture Overview, and a\\nWhite Paper from the Aberdeen Group illustrating the importance of Strategic\\nRelationship Management.\\n\\nI know it can sometimes be difficult to understand a solution from a simple\\nemail. For a demonstration, or for more information on how we can help you\\nmaximize the value of your strategic relationships, please contact me at\\nyour earliest convenience.

The 600 online courses available through the program are in English and\\nSpanish and include everything from computer basics to various levels of\\ntechnical certification. This generous gift to TFA will be utilized over a\\nthree year period and has a retail value of approximately $45 million. A key\\ncomponent of the gift will be the inclusion of a \"SmartJobs\" section on the\\nweb site that will list companies doing business with SmartForce that have\\npledged to interview job applicants who successfully complete training\\nthrough a TFA/SmartForce course. Scott Yeager will call Greg Priest, CEO of\\nSmarforce, on behalf of TFA and thank him for this generous gift toward the\\nTechnology For All initiative.\\n\\nAMERICA CONNECTS CONSORTIUM\\nTFA is working with the America Connects Consortium (ACC) to help support\\nCommunity Technology Centers across the US. The ACC received recently\\nreceived a $2 million Department of Education  grant to support CTC efforts.\\nThe benefits to TFA include program support for existing TFA programs and\\nthe ability to share best practices across the US. The consortium will\\nassist TFA in its city by city model by helping encourage exisiting\\norganizations to work together. In addition to sharing TFA online content\\nTFA will also host online curriculum resources created by the consortium on\\nthe private side of our web site.  The work of the Consortium will begin\\nwith an organizational meeting in Boston, November 15-16.  For more\\ninformation read the full release posted on the TFA web site at.\\nhttp://www.techforall.org/showdoc.cfm?id=35&ret=new\\n\\nBLUECURRENT RELATIONSHIP FINALIZED\\nTFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bluecurrent.  Through\\nthe relationship Bluecurrent will assist TFA with the management and\\ndonation of corporate technology assets across the US.  Through the creative\\nuse of donated assets as \"currency\" the Bluecurrent relationship will save\\nTFA $13.5 million in projected cash expenses over the next five years to\\nprocess and redeploy corporate technology assets donated to TFA.  In\\naddition, we believe this relationship will dramatically increase the\\ncomputers available to TFA and its program partners.  For more information\\nabout Bluecurrent go to http://www.bluecurrent.com .\\n\\nLINCT COALITION \"LEARN AND EARN\" PROGRAM TO EMPOWER\\nOne of the beneficiaries of the Bluecurrent relationship will be the ability\\nof TFA to more quickly rollout the TFA/LINCT coalition \"Learn and Earn\"\\nProgram. This program will allow disadvantaged persons who participate in\\nthe program to learn how to use a computer and then mentor another person\\nusing the same curriculum. By completing both parts of this cross-age peer\\ntutoring program, participants will then \"earn\" a computer to take home,\\nthus creating new opportunities for education and economic empowerment.\\nMore information about the LINCT coalition \"learn and earn\" program can be\\nfound at http://www.linct.org/\\n\\nDIGITAL DIVIDENDS CONFERENCE, SEATTLE\\nTwo weeks ago I attended the Digital Dividends Conference in Seattle.  The\\nfocus of the Conference was \"creating digital dividends\" and exploreing\\ninnovative approaches to closing the global digital divide.  The conference\\nwas hosted by the World Resources Institute, chaired by William D.\\nRuckelshaus, and reviewed business modesl and market development strategies\\nto close the digital divide.  I made several important connections at the\\nconference including key personnel with Hewlett Packard.  Carly Fiorina,\\nHP\\'s CEO, announced a huge global initiative by Hewlett Packard to address\\nthe digital divide in 1000 villages across the world.\\n\\nASIA FOUNDATION RELATIONSHIP BEING DEVELOPED\\nThrough the introduction of Enron lobbyist David Merrill, former ambassador\\nto Bangladesh during the Bush adminstration, TFA met last week with the\\nPresident and several staff members of the Asia Foundation. The Asia\\nFoundation supports economic development and other efforts in Asia and is\\nfunded by private contributions and the US State Department. The Asia\\nFoundation indicated an interest in working together with TFA in the future\\nas Enron expands its backbone to Japan and other Asian countries.\\n\\nLAY AND TROTTER ASSIST IN FUNDRAISING EFFORTS\\nTFA and its local affiliate Technology For All-Houston are working together\\nto follow through on grant requests of $5 million over a three year period\\nfrom Houston area foundations.  We have had initially o\\\\positive responses\\nfrom Houston Endowment and the Brown Foundation as well as several smaller\\nfoundations including the Hamman Foundation and the Sterling Turner\\nFoundation. We are also preparing requests to Houston area corporations and\\nfriends of TFA that will go out in the next few weeks.  A bridge loan from\\nthe Redstone bank has been secured to get us through the next couple of\\nmonths. TFA anticipates a need for $4.5 million in cash over the next twelve\\nmonths to help us build capacity and long term sustainability.  With the\\ncreative business relationships being created we expect to be able to insure\\nsustainability of the organization after the initial capacity is secured.\\nHowever, until that time, TFA will be dependent upon the cash and in-kind\\ncontributions of foundations, corporations, its board members and friends.\\n\\nPROGRESS CONTINUES ON IVERCITY DEAL\\nThe IverCity \"deal\" is an example of an innovative and creative solution for\\nlong-term sustainability.  Through the co-branding of the TFA/IverCity web\\nsite, we hope to drive web users to IverCity content and thus create the\\npotential for a IverCity liquidity event that will benefit TFA\\'s long term\\ncapital needs.  Jack Clark has done a superb job creating the draft of the\\nlegal document outlining the deal.  We thank Jack Trotter for his suggestion\\nto create a convertible royalty rather than just equity by itself.  The\\nbenefit to TFA is the ability for TFA to be compensated by the number of\\nusers we direct to the IverCity content which will be useful to TFA\\nconstituents.\\n\\nROSEMARIE FOSTER TO JOIN TFA AS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT\\nEffective, November 20, Rosemarie Foster will be joining the TFA staff\\nfulltime as administrative assistant.  She will begin working some partime\\nhours this week. Thanks to Jack Trotter and Jack Clark for providing office\\nspace for Rosemarie.  Additional TFA staff are being c\\\\interviewed to assist\\nwith fund-raising, program development, web site development and network\\ninfrastructure support.\\n\\nDISCUSSIONS WITH INTERNET POLICY INSTITUTE\\nJustin Cornett represented TFA recently at a \"town hall\" meeting of the\\nInternet Policy Institute (IPI) in Austin.  The IPI will be working with TFA\\nin our Washington DC rollout. We will be meeting with them again next week\\nin DC. We thank Ken Lay for his initial introductions to the board members\\nand staff of the IPI.\\n\\nNEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, WASHINGTON DC, SAN DIEGO, ATLANTA\\nThrough introductions from TFA board members and others we are beginning to\\ndevelop key contacts in each of the cities noted above.

       " 'Peter,\\n\\nMaterials have been sent to the contacts you made for TFA in LA.

       " \"Ken,  thanks for agreeing to meet with Stedman Graham at two this afternoon.  \\nThe following should give you some talking points and background:\\n\\n Stedman Graham is most noted for being the companion to Oprah Winfrey, \\nhowever he is CEO of two firms which are in the marketing and educational \\nconsulting business.\\n\\n Enron has been discussing using Graham's consulting services for our \\nAssociate program to focus on leadership training and develop.\\n\\n We are considering him as a potential advisory board member for Enron \\nInvestment Partners.  This will be our first meeting with him so we are not \\nyet ready to propose a board seat yet.\\n\\n We also hope that any relationship we develop with him could lead to a \\nconnection with Oprah Winfrey for the purpose of further expanding the \\npublicity for EIP and Enron and also to  access additional investment dollars.\\n\\n Prior to your meeting we will have introduced him to EIP and Enron so he \\nshould be well briefed on the company.  I think it would be good if you could \\nfocus on the activities of EIP and the reason why Enron would be supportive \\nof this type of business since that is always a question that comes up.  I \\nunderstand that Linda will join us during the meeting and want to talk about \\nthe Holocaust Museum and Oprah's potential involvement with it.\\n\\n Also with us will be Danny Lawson whom you have met.  Danny was the mayor's  \\nchief fund raiser for the last two elections and is very active locally.  \\nLast Friday Danny facilitated a meeting between EES and Jew Don Boney for the \\npurpose of moving along the potential energy services contract between EES \\nand the city of Houston.  He has been a strong supporter of ours for quite \\nsome time and is also a candidate for the advisory board.  Danny currently \\nsets on the Cynet board.\\n\\n Please let me know if there is any other information that would be useful\\n\\nGene\",\n",

       " 'Dear Mr. Lay:\\n\\nOn behalf of Assistant Secretary of Defense (C3I) and DoD CIO Arthur Money,\\nI would like to invite you to participate in the Secretary of Defense\\'s\\nHighlands Forum. The Highlands Forum is a cross-disciplinary group of\\neminent scholars, researchers, CEO\\'s/CIO\\'s/CTO\\'s from industry, and leaders\\nfrom the media, the arts and the professions, who have met over the past six\\nyears to examine areas of emerging interest to all of us.  The idea is to\\ngain a better understanding of the new environment we will all be living and\\nworking in, and to examine the fundamental changes that will impact that\\nenvironment.  The Forum includes seniors from the White House, Defense, and\\nother agencies of government (we limit government participation to about\\n25%).  Our meetings over the past six years have covered such diverse topics\\nas \"The Mind, the Brain, and Computing\"; \"The Convergence of Information\\nTechnology and Biotechnology\"; and \"Innovation in Public Sector\\nOrganizations\".  Our meeting in May explored MEMS, nanotechnology, and\\nmolecular computing; among our participants were: Sun Microsystems founder\\nBill Joy, Phil Kuekes of HP, Nobel laureate Rick Smalley. Our last meeting\\nin September focused on the future of software, and participants included\\nInktomi founder Eric Brewer, SUN CTO Greg Papadopoulos, Packet Design CEO\\nJudy Estrin (board member of FedEx and Cisco), and Esther Dyson.\\n\\nThe Forum is an idea engine--there are no reports and no consensus\\nrecommendations. Meeting size is usually kept to around 30 people to remain\\nsmall and informal, encouraging maximum discussion of ideas presented by a\\nspeaker or a panel; we call it strategic conversation.  While there is media\\nparticipation in our meetings, there is no press coverage of the\\ndiscussions.  Our distinguised media participants in this meeting (CEO, UPI;\\nExec. Editor, International Herald Tribune) will take part representing\\nthemselves and will  act as moderators.\\n\\nSeveral of our participants strongly suggested that I contact you to tell\\nyou about the Forum and this particular meeting. We are going to hold\\nHighlands Forum 16 in Washington, DC, on December 14-15 (half day on the\\n15th).  The topic will be built around the search for\\ninformation/transformation strategies for the Department of Defense (and\\ngovernment in general). The Assistant Secretary would like to hold this\\nHighlands to think about the elements of an information strategy, and I have\\nsuggested that we look at information and strategy from a business\\nperspective (transformation, productivity, competitive advantage).  We will\\nlook at  4 or 5 useful business cases for context.  ENRON is a remarkable\\nexample of transformation in a highly rigid, regulated industry, that has\\ncreated a new model and new markets.\\n\\nThe Defense Department is not only creating an operational strategy which\\nhas information superiority (better, faster decision making) at its core;\\nthe Department also has an enormous global business enterprise which can\\nbenefit from many of the best practices and ideas from industry enabling it\\nto achieve greater efficiencies and be a better steward of public funds.\\nClearly, not all the elements translate well from the business envrionment,\\nhowever, many do.  I am interested in business cases which ideally describe\\nan enterprise-level information or transformation strategy--those which see\\nan information strategy as the overarching strategy, or at least as a core\\ncomponent of corporate/operational strategy--use of information technology,\\ninformation protection/assurance, CRM, and perhaps how to use information\\nand technology to transition or capture or create a new market. One\\noperational example that we will look at is Cemex, the Mexican cement\\ncompany that uses I.T. (GPS and communications) to \"swarm\" its trucks in the\\nready cement business. Their COO will be joining us to describe how they\\nsucceeded in dominating their market. In addition to Cemex, other companies\\nrepresented in our agenda include Cisco, eBay, Schwab, and Sourceree.\\n\\nENRON is of great interest to us.  What we learn from you may help the\\nDepartment of Defense a great deal as it works to build a new strategy. I\\nhope that you have time on your busy schedule to join us for as much of the\\nHighlands Forum as you can attend and speak with the group. I would be happy\\nto tell you more about the Forum.  In the meantime, please take a look at\\nthe Secretary\\'s Website for the Forum to get a better idea of what it is and\\nwhat is has accomplished: www.hlforum.com; username: cc27 (lowercase);\\npassword: SVN8 (Uppercase).

       " 'Ken -- You are scheduled to do a 30-minute telephone interview on Thursday at \\n9:30 a.m. with Heidrick & Struggles, which is publishing a journal for the \\nWorld Economic Forum meeting in Davos in January 2001.  This publication will \\ncover corporate leadership and human capital issues in the new economy.  They \\nwant to talk to you for a chapter on \"Leading a Transformation into the New \\nEconomy.\"   The interviewer will be Stephen Miles, and he has submitted the \\nfollowing questions in advance of your conversation.  I will come to your \\noffice at 9:30 a.m. to place the call.\\n\\nThank you.\\nKaren \\n\\n\\n\\n 1. Enron over the past decade has become the most vigorous change agent\\n in its industry.  From a leadership perspective, how have you created a\\n culture of change in an industry not known for change?\\n\\n 2. Nortel Networks has clearly made an outstanding transformation into\\n the New Economy, similar to Enron\\'s evolution. In Nortel\\'s case, John Roth\\n bought Bay Networks and infused the Nortel culture with Bays - almost a\\n reverse cultural transformation.  How did you create a New Economy culture\\n where innovation, risk-taking and new ideas are embraced and rewarded?\\n\\n 3. Are there some best practices you can share with other CEOs and\\n Managing Directors regarding leading a change?\\n\\n 4. At best, change is difficult. But being able to change before you\\n have to has only been accomplished successfully by a few companies.  How\\n did you lead a change effort when you were arguably still a very\\n successful utility?\\n\\n 5. Peter Drucker has said than in stable time you need good management\\n but in disruptive times you need leadership.  How have you been able to\\n attract and retain what Fortune magazine has called the best management\\n team?\\n\\n 6. The New Economy is really all about creating a culture of\\n innovation, where employees see opportunity and not barriers. Enron has\\n been masterful at this from gas, to electricity, pulp & paper, and now\\n bandwidth. As the \"keeper of the culture\" how did you establish and\\n maintain such a culture?\\n\\n 7. As Enron moves away from Plant, Property and Equipment towards\\n Intangible Assets, what has changed for you as a leader in the age of\\n intangibles?\\n\\n 8. Can you list the four or five \"must have\" competencies for the 21st\\n Century CEO? What experiences are necessary?\\n\\n 9. Lets talk about going global. You have made very impressive in-roads\\n in India where no other utility has been able to. How did you lead this\\n effort? Are there any best practices you can share with your fellow CEO\\'s\\n who are thinking about India?\\n\\n 10. Lets now move to Europe. Enron is the largest gas and power trader\\n in Europe. Can you discuss your move into Europe? Again are there some\\n best practices for CEOs in the USA moving into Europe?',\n",

(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Edison\\nInternational\\'s (EIX) Southern California Edison unit and Sempra Energy\\'s\\n(SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric Co. were ordered to submit documents by the\\nend of November stating whether they can build and operate \"peaking\" plants\\nby June 1.\\nThe utilities weren\\'t immediately available to comment.\\nOn the other hand, the ISO - which is on the verge of signing contracts for\\n440 peaking units with between 20 and 91 megawatts of electricity - says\\nthe commission\\'s meddling could endanger any chance of additional resources\\ncoming on line in time.\\n\"Any further interference on the state level could destroy the plan\\naltogether,\" said an ISO source close to the issue. \"There is no guarantee\\nthe utilities will be able to pull this off by next summer. And if the\\nwhole project is scrapped, you can expect there will be blackouts.\"\\nInterference by federal regulators has already cost the ISO two\\nparticipants and nearly 600 megawatts in its peaking program.\\nCalpine Corp. (CPN) and Enron (ENE) initially agreed to build peaking\\nplants for the ISO next summer, but withdrew their offers after the Federal\\nEnergy Regulatory Commission proposed capping the clearing price for\\nCalifornia\\'s wholesale electricity market at $150 a megawatt-hour.\\nThe ISO, which operates one of the state\\'s wholesale power markets and\\nmanages most of the high-voltage transmission grid, has already solicited\\nand received bids from merchant generators for 1,800 megawatts of new\\npeaking power for next summer.\\nBurned by the summer\\'s power crisis and facing an 8,000-MW shortfall next\\nsummer, the ISO put out a request for bids in August. The ISO\\'s board voted\\nOct. 30 to enter into the contracts, which it estimated would cost about\\n$250 million a year for three years.\\nThe state\\'s Electricity Oversight Board, which oversees the performance of\\nthe ISO, and the Public Utilities Commission protested the decision on the\\ngrounds that the contracts were too expensive.\\nThe commission is also questioning whether there is even a need for peaking\\npower next summer and, if there is, whether the ISO should handle the\\nsolicitation.\\n\"The question also arises as to whether the ISO - which is empowered only\\nto operate the state\\'s transmission system and which does not represent the\\nstate or its consumers - is the appropriate organization to plan, solicit\\nand pay for the construction of new power plants across the state,\" the\\ncommission wrote in its Nov. 2 order.\\nInd the end, the decision is up to state regulators. If utilities can come\\nup with a cheaper alternative and if the regulators determine that\\nadditional generation is needed by next summer, then they will follow\\nthrough with the utilities proposal.',\n",

Incidently, but not surprisingly, all three of \\nthese Palm\\nBeach officials are Democrats.\\n\\nWhat Gore/Lieberman Campaign Chairman Richard Daley is orchestrating is as \\noutrageous\\nas what his father did in 1960 in Cook County Illinois in stealing the \\nelection from John Kennedy.\\n\\nPoint blank, Al Gore is not as honorable as Richard Nixon was in 1960 and \\nGerald Ford was\\nin 1976 when both Republican candidates conceded the close elections despite \\ncampaign\\nadvisors\\' requests for recounts.  They put the interests of the country ahead \\nof their own\\npersonal interest in the White House.  They knew then that recounting ad \\ninfinitum would\\nproduce pluses and minuses in vote counts; but they trusted that the votes \\nwould balance\\nout if all precincts were recounted.

The award\\nfollows Iranian Offshore Engineering and Construction (OIEC) and Singapore\\'s\\nSembCorp winning the $60m contract for installation of the platform to\\nprocess 40,000bbl/d of oil and 14mcfd of associated gas.\\nThe Anglo-Norwegian group was brought in by NIOC subsidiary Petro Pars in\\nApril to manage the first phase development of South Pars gas field. In a\\nseparate development, OIEC and Petro Iran are reported to be looking for a\\nforeign partner to take a 30% stake in the $850m Salman offshore project,\\nwhich the two Iranian companies won in October on a buy-back basis. The\\nSalman contract, tendered in 1998, requires the rebuilding of war-damaged\\nfacilities and upgrading production at the field by 45,000 bbl/d to 130,000\\nbbl/d as well as developing an associated gas structure. http://www.irna.com\\n\\n\\nOPEC TO SUSPEND 20-DAY MECHANISM UNTIL JANUARY\\nVienna - OPEC exporters have rejected calls from consuming nations for\\nfurther extra crude supplies that would have helped ease stubbornly high\\nworld oil prices and cut fuel bills this winter. It appears, as the\\nMinisters meet in Austria this month, that OPEC will not be adding further\\nincreases to world supplies despite oil prices remaining outside its\\nautomatic 20-day production increase mechanism, set at $22-28/bbl. \\'There\\nwill be no increases this year under any circumstances,\\' Indonesian Oil\\nMinister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told awaiting reporters after a two-hour\\nmeeting ahead of the formal ratification of the decision.\\nhttp://www.opec.org/\\n\\n\\nSUDAN SIGN EXPLORATION AGREEMENT\\nKhartoum - Sudan has signed an oil exploration agreement with several local\\nand international companies for an area in central Sudan, the\\ngovernment-owned Al-Anbaa newspaper reported on Sunday. \\'Sudan has signed a\\nproduction agreement...covering prospecting, development and transportation\\nof oil with Gulf oil companies, the Chinese National Petroleum Corp, Al Than\\nand Sudapet,\\' the daily said.\\nAl-Anbaa said the agreement covered a 75sq.km area on the western bank of\\nthe White Nile, south of the town of Rabak, about 275km south of Khartoum.\\nThe Gulf companies hold a 46% stake in the investment, the Chinese company\\nhas 23%, Al Than also has 23% and Sudapet holds 8%.\\nSudan, which produces about 185,000 barrels per day of crude oil, began\\ncrude exports in August 1999. It had previously been importing oil and oil\\nproducts for about $300m a year, eating up most of its export earnings. It\\nhas also been reported this week that Talisman Energy are to step up their\\nexploration efforts in the country, despite opposition from humanitarian\\ngroups.\\n\\n\\nSHELL INK EGYPTIAN GTL AGREEMENT\\nCairo - Royal Dutch/Shell Group confirmed this week that they are to invest\\n$1.7bn in an Egyptian gas-to-liquids (GTL) plant that could lead the country\\nto use domestic gas reserves to satisfy its entire oil products market for\\nmore than 50 years.\\nEgypt is currently an importer of oil products. The oil giant agreed to\\ninitial terms on the deal early in October. Shell said it has now signed a\\ndevelopment protocol with Egyptian General Petroleum for a\\n75,000-barrel-per-day GTL conversion plant to convert natural gas into\\nsynthetic fuels. Crucially the project is now said to have the backing of\\nEgyptian Petroleum Minister Sameh Fahmy. Production could be in place by\\nlate 2005, while a plant at the same site producing liquefied natural gas\\n(LNG) could be up and running earlier, by mid-2004.\\n\\n\\n\\n******FREE ISSUES OF THE MENA PETROLEUM BULLETIN******\\n\\nAs a subscriber to MENA E-News we would like to offer you a two-month trial\\nsubscription to the MENA Petroleum Bulletin absolutely free!\\n\\nThe MENA Petroleum Bulletin analyses the major developments in the region\\'s\\noil, gas, power and petrochemical sectors.

       " 'You had asked for my input on a response to a letter you received from Tom \\nDonahue regarding increasing Enron\\'s contribution to the US Chamber to \\n$100,000.  I have been giving the Chamber a bit of a hard time lately and \\nwanted you to know why.\\n\\nI have been in touch with both Tom and his staff over the last year.  Donahue \\nhas done a very good job raising money and getting his membership rolls up, \\nboth in terms of membership and dollar contribution per member.  My \\nreservation about the Chamber is that they won\\'t take a stand on something \\nwhich is in the best interests of the vast majority of their membership if it \\nwill alienate a vocal few.  Electric restructuring was a key example of \\nthis.  There was no doubt where they should have been on the issue, but \\ninstead of embracing retail open access legislation at the federal level they \\ndecided to have a \"process\".  Naturally, all the utilities volunteered to \\nparticipate in the process and outnumbered the nonutility members when it \\ncame time to vote.  The vote supported wholesale, but not retail, reform \\n(with heavy emphasis on ensuring stranded cost recovery).  Afterwards, the \\nfederal debate shifted solely to wholesale legislation (though this is not \\nexclusively the Chamber\\'s fault).\\n\\nUnfortunately, Tom\\'s forceful and competitive approach when it comes to \\nraising his membership rolls leaves him unwilling to do the right thing if a \\nfew members will be upset.  For Enron it\\'s a bit like paying $100,000 for a \\nveto right.  The only things the organization pushes for are the things \\neveryone agrees on in the business community -- eg China PNTR and lower \\ncorporate taxes -- things they will push for whether we pay dues or not (and \\nthings we will add our separate voice to in any event).  \\n\\nAs I have explained to the Chamber, Enron makes its money challenging \\nconventional wisdom, changing the way markets work, and dislocating \\nincumbents.  Anything important that we stand for is likely to alienate some \\nmembers of the business community and the Chamber is unlikely to stand with \\nus.  They represent the status quo in the business community.  Tom is an \\nextremely promising leader; he needs to create a new kind of voice for the \\nbusiness community.  A voice which stands for moving business to the next \\nlevel, not just protecting its current position.\\n\\nHaving said all that, the Chamber (particularly its international chapters) \\nhas been useful to us in the past.  In previous years, Donahue himself has \\nintervened on our behalf with Latin American leaders.  As a consequence, I \\nhave asked them for a proposal which would allow us to remain Chamber members \\nat a lower dues (and policy participation) level, but with continuing access \\nto their international activities.  I suggested something in the $25,000 \\nrange.

The Competition Bureau declined to comment on\\nthe status of the case.\\n  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of\\nprovincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny\\nbreaking any rules or laws.\\n  From Powerex\\'s point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for\\nhigh power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.\\n  \"They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market\\ndesign flaws,\" Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow\\nJones Newswires in an interview.\\n   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame\\n  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every \\nderegulating\\nmarket Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.\\n  \"Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even\\noil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,\\nthere have been investigations done,\" Palmer said.\\n  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets\\ninvestigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the\\nfirst such investigation into Powerex\\'s actions, Peterson said.\\n  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won\\'t say whether the investigaion\\nis ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.\\n  The companies themselves said they\\'re not sure of the investigation\\'s \\nstatus.\\nTheir seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn\\'t heard\\nfrom the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week\\nwith a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.\\n  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta\\'s system controllers\\nnoticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 \\nwith\\nunusual frequency.\\n  The Pool\\'s price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power\\nfor the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount\\nof power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes\\nbefore the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power\\nneeded by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to\\nmeet demand.\\n   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed\\n  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and\\nEnron were rigging their bids in the following manner:\\n  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two \\nminutes\\nlater, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,\\nbut at a \"significantly higher price,\" according to the warrant application.\\nSometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its\\noffer.\\n  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada\\'s gas\\ntrading group, found that \"as a result of restatements, involving mostly\\nPowerex and Enron,\" the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to\\nbetween C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and\\n10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.\\n  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau\\'s Bloom,\\nconcluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the\\npower was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the\\nhigher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume\\noffered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be\\nneeded, and every participant would get the higher price.\\n  Powerex\\'s Peterson doesn\\'t take issue with the trade history as detailed by\\nthe Bureau, but denies that the company\\'s traders were doing anything wrong or\\nthat the two companies had some sort of arrangement.\\n  \"And we\\'re adamant about that,\" Peterson said. \"There was no deal with \\nEnron.\\nThere was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a\\nchange in prices or anything like that.\"\\n  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company\\'s\\nrisk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,\\nPeterson said.\\n  \"Whenever Enron\\'s offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments \\nof\\nEnron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,\\nPowerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced\\nunit,\" according to the warrant application.\\n  Peterson\\'s response: \"We\\'re operating in a very tight market there and we\\nfelt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta.\"\\n  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.\\n  \"It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we\\ncould sell it at,\" Enron\\'s Thode said. \"And that\\'s what Enron and every other\\ncompany does that\\'s in the business of trading.\"\\n  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies\\' actions between June 1, \\n1999,\\nand Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,\\nessentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public\\nits investigation into Powerex and Enron.\\n  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the\\ninvestigation.\\n  \"Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the\\ninterests and activities of market participants,\" he said.\\n  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at\\nthe court\\'s discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn\\'t\\nlikely affect Powerex\\'s ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada\\n\"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to\\ninhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power.\"\\n  Companies Concerned About Reputations\\n  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex\\nreputation.\\n  \"Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at\\nstake from a reputational point of view,\" Peterson said. \"Both companies, I\\nbelieve, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are\\ndifficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and\\nCalifornia and people looking for somebody to blame. There\\'s always a\\npossibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved.\"\\n  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of\\nAlberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,\\nlinking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market\\nsurveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.\\n\\n  Company Web sites: http://www.powerex.com, http://www.enron.com\\n\\n  -By Cheryl Kim, Dow Jones Newswires; 416-306-2017; cheryl.kim@dowjones.com\\n\\n  (END) DOW JONES NEWS  11-21-00\\n  03:31 PM- - 03 31 PM EST 11-21-00\\n ',\n",

We had our \\nkickoff event in the 50th floor dining room on March 7th of this year and \\nhave received substantial interest in our organization.  I wanted to drop you \\na line to tell you not only about us, but also what we are doing.  As of \\ntoday, we have 107 employees that have expressed interest in contributing to \\nour group\\'s success. We have several stated objectives:\\n\\n1. Network Enron Cougars together to build strong working relationships.  \\nThis will benefit the employees as well as the company.\\n2. Raise and present scholarships to Enron dependents to attend the \\nUniversity of Houston.  This will help to ease education costs.\\n3. Assist the company in its recruiting efforts concerning the university.\\n4. Assist the university through financial gifts whenever possible.\\n\\nCurrently, here is what we have planned:\\n\\n4/15/2000 The HAO has given us their hall at \"Frontier Fiesta\".   Frontier \\nFiesta is a festival thrown by the students and alumni that provides good \\nfamily   fun. The HAO is having it catered and everyone is invited.\\n\\n9/16/2000 We are throwing a tailgate party to celebrate Dana Dimel\\'s first \\nhome football game against Army.  We are working with Chet Gladchuk to set up \\na   tent, have it catered, listen to a live band, football tickets, etc.  We \\nwould like to make this event open to all of Enron if possible.  The \\nuniversity will   provide Enron special recognition on both the Cougar Vision \\nScoreboard and over the PA in both the first and second half of the contest.\\n\\nThese are the confirmed events so far as we are still in the opening stages.  \\nWe anticipate to have more events planned (golf tournament) which I would \\nlike the opportunity to share with you.  This group is designed to cater to \\nits members, the company, and the university and I believe it is going to be \\none of the most successful out there.  To achieve such a plateau, however, we \\nneed to be a continuous draw to old and new alumni alike.  To have you as an \\nalumni is truly a monumental draw to our employees and the university.

If there are any suggestions that you may have as to \\nhow to further our group, I would love to hear them.  I understand that you \\nare extremely busy and I do not wish to monopolize your time but this alumni \\ncharter is something that I truly believe in and I hope you will agree that \\nit has great potential.

Immelt, the man chosen to succeed the legendary Jack Welch as=20\\nchief executive of General Electric Co., knows there\\'s just one person=20\\nkeeping him in business: the customer. And that customer is the person Imme=\\nlt=20\\ngoes all-out to please.\\nImmelt, 44, was plucked from the company\\'s fast-growing GE Medical Systems=\\n=20\\nbusiness, where he had served as president and chief executive since 1997.=\\n=20\\nThe $7 billion unit, based in Waukesha, Wis., is a world leader in medical=\\n=20\\ndiagnostic technology and information systems.\\nImmelt attributes much of his success to his laserlike focus on sales.\\n\"I love working with customers. . . . Sales has really influenced everythin=\\ng=20\\nI do. It has instilled in me the important traits of operating with a sense=\\n=20\\nof urgency and listening to people,\" Immelt said.\\nImmelt on Monday was named president and chairman-elect of GE. He will=20\\nsucceed John F. \"Jack\" Welch Jr., GE\\'s chairman and CEO, when Welch retires=\\n=20\\nat the end of 2001.\\nWhen Immelt landed at GE Medical Systems in 1997, he quickly showed a knack=\\n=20\\nfor squeezing growth from a unit known for sluggish sales. Last year, its=\\n=20\\nrevenue jumped 23% to $6 billion.\\nCustomers credit Immelt with going way beyond sales. When Chicago\\'s=20\\nNorthwestern Memorial Hospital expanded its scanning services last year,=20\\nImmelt spent hours helping to manage its work flow.\\n\"That\\'s the kind of collaboration that we find unusual,\" Northwestern=20\\nMemorial CEO Gary Mecklenburg told Business Week.\\nImmelt has proven himself both by turning around troubled GE divisions and=\\n=20\\nextracting better performance from thriving units.\\nImmelt knows how important it is to set the pace, not follow it. To keep GE=\\n=20\\nMedical flourishing, he\\'s pushed the unit to expand acquisitions and new=20\\nproduct offerings. The division\\'s product line ranges from ultrasound devic=\\nes=20\\nused in doctors\\' offices to multimillion-dollar CT and MRI scanners.\\nIn his earlier work in GE\\'s Plastics division, Immelt stood out by persuadi=\\nng=20\\nhard-boiled carmakers to substitute plastics for metal on some parts.\\nAs vice president of consumer service for GE\\'s Appliances division, Immelt=\\n=20\\ndeftly handled the fallout from a recall of refrigerator compressors. To ke=\\nep=20\\nworkers\\' morale pumped up during the recall, Immelt would often climb up on=\\n a=20\\nforklift in GE\\'s Louisville, Ky., plant and pass out words of encouragement=\\n=20\\nand praise. He took time to speak with employees during such sessions,=20\\nlistening carefully to their ideas and concerns.\\nImmelt believes that open, fast communication with workers is crucial. Not =\\na=20\\ntable-thumper, he meets with employees =01) sometimes hundreds at a time =\\n=01) to=20\\ndiscuss where GE Medical is going. Colleagues say he works at=20\\nconsensus-building, urging others to understand different points of view.\\nAfter returning from corporate meetings, Immelt distills the latest GE=20\\nthinking on videotape, and copies are sent to offices around the world.\\nUnderstanding that seeing someone face to face helps foster stronger=20\\nrelationships, Immelt also travels often to meet employees and customers.=\\n=20\\nConstant contact keeps a company united, Immelt believes.

The event as outlined below is scheduled for \\nMarch 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.\\n\\nKevin\\n\\n----- Forwarded by Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications on 11/29/00 08:38 AM \\n-----\\n\\n\\tras22@cornell.edu\\n\\t11/29/00 06:19 AM\\n\\t\\t \\n\\t\\t To: Kevin Hannon/Enron Communications@Enron Communications\\n\\t\\t cc: \\n\\t\\t Subject: \\n\\nKevin-\\n\\n\\nJust a quick follow-up on my November 2 email regarding Enron\\'s\\nparticipation in the Johnson School\\'s March Leadership Week and the\\npossibility of doing a case study on Enron.  Wondered if you have had a\\nchance to float these ideas with Jeff or Ken?  I know you have lots on\\nyou plate.  Let me know if you have any sense of how this might go. \\nBelow is the earlier email I sent to you.  Thanks for the help.  Hope all\\nis well with you.\\n\\n\\n            Nov.2 email text\\n\\n\\nWe at Cornell\\'s Johnson School would like to establish a stronger link\\nwith Enron, a company which we believe to be a leading example of the\\nagile organization which will dominate in the dynamic, unpredictable\\nmarkets of the next decade.  One connecting point which we would like\\nEnron to consider is with our Center for Leadership in Dynamic\\nOrganizations which draws faculty and students from across Cornell and\\nbeyond.\\n\\n\\nThe specific activities that we propose at this point in time are two. \\nFirst, we would like to invite a senior leader from Enron to be a key\\nspeaker at the Johnson School\\'s Leadership Week in March, 2001.  As\\ndescribed in the attached materials, Leadership Week is made up of three\\nconferences focused on academic faculty, leading-edge corporations and\\nstudents.  We very much would like Enron to present what we call a \"live\\ncase study\" at the corporate conference on <underline>March 28,\\n2001</underline>.\\n\\n\\nYou, of course, are an obvious candidate to do this.  Alternatively, this\\nis the kind of event that is made to order for Jeff Skilling or Ken Lay\\nand would give them a chance to interact with other corporate leaders and\\nthe Cornell community.  Other corporate leaders we have signed up for the\\ncorporate conference are John Loose, President and COO of Corning, Ken\\nChenault, incoming CEO of American Express, Marty Coyne, just announced\\nPresident of Kodak\\'s new Commercial Group.  Each of these leaders has a\\ndistinct message to deliver about the leadership challenges involved in\\ncontinually reinventing themselves in a fast-changing marketplace.  \\n\\n\\nWe have several other speakers lined up for other parts of Leadership\\nWeek, including Ken Blanchard and, we think, Abbey Cohen from Goldman\\nSachs.  We have some chance of getting Bill Ford from Ford Motor Company\\nand an outside shot at Jack Welch through our President Emeritus Frank\\nRhodes, but these are still long shots.\\n\\n\\nThe point is that this is the biggest thing that will happen at the\\nJohnson School and probably at Cornell next year.  If Jeff or Ken wanted\\na platform for telling the Enron story, this would be a good one.  If\\nthey can\\'t do it, hopefully we could convince you to do it.  Again, the\\ndate is March 28, 2001.       \\n\\n\\nThe second proposal is to develop a teaching case on Enron along the same\\nlines.  In fact, if we started working on the teaching case soon, it\\ncould become the basis for the March conference live case study\\npresentation.  We believe that Enron is unique in its ability to\\nliterally create new markets.  The question is how do you lead and manage\\nan organization to keep the tight financial and risk controls in place\\nthat you do, but still create the entrepreneurial behavior that seems to\\nbe the case at Enron.  What kind of management philosophies, systems and\\npractices make this possible.\\n\\n\\nI know that Enron was the subject of two Harvard cases in 1993 and around\\n1997.  As I understand it neither focused on organizational and\\nleadership issues.  We would like to devote a small research team to\\nbuilding this case about Enron, directed by myself and Professor Lee Dyer\\nfrom the ILR School.  We would need access to a number of people in the\\nEnron organization, but are very aware of the demands on time for fast\\nmoving organizations and are committed to doing this in a very efficient\\nway.\\n\\n\\nKevin, we appreciate your willingness to entertain these two ideas and\\nhopefully test them with your top leaders.  We will do anything we can to\\nmake it feasible for Enron to engage with us on these two initiatives. \\nPlease let me know what I can do to help you carry this forward.  As\\nalways, thanks for your great personal support.\\n\\n\\nDick\\n',\n",

According to Amy Fitzpatrick, the HR \\nRep in Portland, when he interviewed he was extremely unimpressive.  \\nConsequently, he was not extended an offer by the Portland Office.  When they \\ncalled to tell him such, his response was, \"that\\'s OK because I did not want \\nto work there anyway.\"\\n\\nI am doubtful that he will fare well in the interview process but will bring \\nhim in if that is what is desired.
